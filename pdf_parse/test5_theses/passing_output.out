I would first like to acknowledge my academic adviser and dissertation director,
Dr. Iris Rotberg, for her wisdom and guidance throughout my doctoral program. Her
feedback was always sincere, reasoned, and thoughtful. She has been a wonderful
mentor, and I am very thankful for her expertise and encouragement.
I would like to thank my committee members, Dr. Colin Green and Dr. Sharon
Dannels, for their commitment and contributions during the dissertation process. Dr.
Green’s strong understanding of the realities of high-poverty schools and his keen eye
toward issues of equity helped remind me of the importance of this work, inspiring me to
do it well. Dr. Dannels’s sage advice helped strengthen the methodology of this study. I
am a stronger researcher and writer because of her. Special thanks also go to my editor,
Cynthia Orticio, for her invaluable assistance and willingness to work on a tight schedule.
In addition, this dissertation would not have been completed were it not for the
unwavering support of my friends, especially Jennifer Whitson, Margaux Hanes Brown,
Ashley Briggs, and Ferry Stepancic. They encouraged me, they challenged me, they
inspired me, and they celebrated with me. The Friday Night Dissertation Club has been
one of the most valuable experiences of my life. Thanks also to “the Panera Office” for
providing my primary workspace and for the free Wi-Fi and refills of coffee.
Finally and most importantly, I want to acknowledge my husband, P.J., for his
support and patience and for his commitment to helping me achieve my goals. There are
many ups and downs in the process of writing a dissertation, but his love was constant. I
am forever grateful.

First and foremost, I have two very important people to thank for supporting me
and keeping me on track over the past ten years of my education: my mom and my dad.
Thank you both for the unconditional love and support in the form of phone calls, emails,
visits, and care packages. Dad, thank you for emphasizing the importance of pursuing
higher education when I was a little girl. I heard your message loud and clear, although I
doubt you ever expected me to go to university for ten years. I have felt your loving
support and pride every step of the way. Thank you for being my biggest cheerleader.
Mom, thank you for being you – a kind, optimistic, and compassionate woman. You
have always accepted me without judgment and for that I cannot thank you enough. You
are a constant reminder to stay balanced and embrace the lighthearted side of life.
My wonderful girlfriend, Melissa Butler, also has been a major source of support
throughout my journey in graduate school. Melissa, thank you for being patient and
giving me the time, space, and support I needed to complete my masters and doctoral
degrees. Thank you for your unconditional love and acceptance and for always making
me smile and laugh.
This dissertation has been a work in progress for over three years and the person
for whom I would like to express my utmost gratitude for helping me is my research
supervisor, Dr. Patti Timmons Fritz. Patti, I must thank you for your support, belief in
my ability to succeed, and encouragement to apply for awards, scholarships, and
conferences. You have always made your students a priority, even when your schedule
was busy and the demands on your personal and professional life were countless.
Graduate school would not have been the same without you and I can only hope that I
will follow in your footsteps as an outstanding supervisor to my students in the future.
There are many other people I would like to thank for a variety of reasons: Drs.
Kimberley Babb, Betty Barrett, Dennis Jackson, and Gregory Stuart for being on my
dissertation committee; Leyco Wilson, Kassandra Zorzan, Betty Zhang, Alyssa
Beaudoin, and Maria van Duinhoven for their help with running participants, coding
responses, and entering data; Brianna O’Neil for assisting me with literature reviews; Dr.
Amy Holtzworth-Munroe for sharing some of her study measures and procedures with
me; and Drs. Joseph Hilbe, David Atkins, and Jeremy Dawson for taking time out of their
busy days to lend me their statistical advice. Last, but certainly not least, I’d like to thank
Barb Zakoor, our graduate secretary, for making me feel so welcomed when I first began
graduate school and for taking such good care of us graduate students.
Lastly, I must thank my amazing friends and colleagues at the University of
Windsor: Holly Ambrose, Kelly Anthony-Brown, Anna Arcuri, Vanessa Bruce, Andrea
Kapeleris, Bojana Knezevic, and Jen Long. You ladies made my graduate school
experience one to remember and I will never forget all of the great times we had together.
Despite the growing distance between us as we move on to the next phase of our lives, I
know we can always rely on each other for support, encouragement, and friendship. To
all my non-graduate school friends – thank you for your understanding, love, and support
over the last six years. I promise you will soon never have to hear the words “sorry, I
can’t…” and “dissertation” in the same sentence again. Cheers to the next chapter!

The acknowledgements are numerous as there are so many individuals and groups of
people who helped to see me through this arduous yet rewarding process.
Firstly, I thank my Heavenly Father. He inspired this work. He held me in His mighty
hands from day one and guided me on this journey. I am blessed with His remarkable faith in
me to complete this dissertation and achieve this honorable degree in educational leadership. He
gave me motivation when I felt distracted or lost, the perseverance when I could not write
another word, and grace as I finished each chapter, the proposal, and ultimately the defense. I
am nothing without you, Lord, and I will live all my days loving You first, as you first loved me
and continue to shine the light on the path of my journey to serve You. Throughout this writing
process, this verse has been a constant reminder of Jesus’ love: “I can do all things through
Christ who strengthens me” (Philippians 4:13).
To my family of origin, namely my parents, sister, and auntfrom the beginning you
have supported me. Dad, when I first read the Edgewood letter of acceptance in June of 2010,
you told me to “Go for it.” I am so happy I took that advice. There were times when it got hard,
but you were there for me as you always are. Thank you, Dad. The “mole” in cell nine has
emerged and loves you very much. Mom, you never wavered in your loving support and faith in
me. More times than I can remember; you helped me out by picking up our kids, cooking a meal
or two, and even helped with the laundry, all so that I could remain on task to meet my deadlines.
I am so lucky to call you my mom - I love you. To my “kid” sister, Leslieyou have been one
of my biggest fans and my “rock” in so many ways. Thanks for grounding me - I love you. To
my Aunt Sandi, my loving auntieWhat can I say about a person who touches my life daily
even though we live 3000 miles apart? Your love, prayers, confidence, and faith in my abilities
were and are always carried in my heart. Thank you - I love you so.
To my advisor, Dr. Steven Salerno, you are certainly a godsend to me in this endeavor.
From day one, I knew you were the right advisor for me. Thank you for your time, energy,
wisdom, and advice. Your kindness, guidance, and perspective taught me more than you will
ever know. Whenever I emailed, texted, or called for your advice, support or to vent my
frustrations, you were always there for me as you remained grounded, supportive, encouraging,
and comforting. I will remember the words “It’s a marathon, not a sprint, we’ll get to the finish
line together in due time.” Thank you, my advisor, my mentor, and my friend.
To the faculty and staff of Edgewood College, Dr. Peter Burke, Dr. Tom Evert, Dr. Pam
Nash, Dr. Bette Lang, Dr. Muriel Simms and Dr. Claire Thoreson your guidance and support
as my committee was insightful and enriching. I appreciate your encouragement and direction.
The end product has been made possible because of that guidance. Also, to Angela Nigro, Karen
Martin, and Lindsay Cummingseach of you had a particular interest in guiding me through the
final stages of seeing my work through to completion, publication, and graduation. Thank you
for your time and dedication to the success of this dissertation. To Cohort X, I will never forget
our many laughs, lessons, and camaraderie over the past three years. I especially want to thank
Kris Mueller for her endearing friendship, support, and assistance with data exportation and
advice along the way. You know you mean the world to me.
I must acknowledge two very important people who serve as inspiration for the pursuit
and direction of this doctorate in one way or another. To my high school English teacher, Dr.
Jerri BrewerJerri, before I ever decided to earn my doctorate, you were the only one I knew
who had achieved this honor. I admired you so much for accomplishing such an arduous task.
You inspired me to do the same. Thank you for being that person who continues to guide, care
about, and inspire others with your work in education and your special friendship. As busy as
you are, you still make time for me. Thank you, Jerri, for inspiring me through your own
example.
Last, with sincere affection and deep appreciation, I want to acknowledge Mr. Robert
Devich, my final principal. Robert, without ever saying a word you inspired me to write my
dissertation on teachers’ perceptions of school leaders. You are an exemplary principal. I have
nothing but the utmost respect for you. Your leadership, your commitment to character
education, and your friendship will be remembered fondly in my heart each day as I strive to be
like you, in the field of education. If there were a way I could be in two places at once, I would
have never left Pacific Rim Elementary School because you inspire students to be their best, you
have high expectations for teachers, and you model teamwork with parents every day of the
school year. Mr. D., as I step into the direction of administration, I pray for the blessings to
follow in your footsteps. Thank you for the inspiration and God Bless. ~ TC

This dissertation would not have been possible without the good faith and support
of an entire community of colleagues, friends, and family.
The members of my committee were all incredibly generous with their time and
their thoughts. The dissertation—and I as a scholar—benefited profoundly from James
Lebovic’s patient guidance. Through countless “two-pagers”, meetings, and emails he
helped me to clarify my ideas, concepts, and vision for the project and never once
expressed doubt about the project or his student. The initial idea for this dissertation
emerged during conversations with Kimberly Morgan during an independent study on
gender in International Relations. Without her encouragement and advice writing a
dissertation on sexual violence would have been a far more daunting endeavor. I owe
Michael Barnett many thanks for recommending the addition of new, big ideas each time
he read a draft. Some of the most interesting sections of the dissertation resulted directly
from our conversations. Aisling Swaine and Patricia Weitsman kindly read the full draft
of the dissertation and offered their expert insights in response.
Barbara Miller and the entire Global Gender Program community helped me view
the project through an interdisciplinary lens and provided a safe space to think and talk
about the complexities of gender and international affairs. Martha Finnemore offered a
receptive ear and helpful advice in the form of many thoughtful conversations and emails.
Kelly Bauer, Jake Haselswerdt, and Michelle Jurkovich read numerous prospectus drafts
and chapter outlines and provided general moral support, good cheer, and delicious baked
goods throughout the research and writing process. I also wish to thank Steven Balla,
Rachel Stein, Elizabeth Saunders, and Robert Adcock for sharing their thoughts about the
project at various stages of its development.
The Young Scholars Network and the Missing Peace Symposium, under the
leadership of Kathleen Kuehnast and Chantal de Jonge Oudraat, is a vibrant community
of scholars studying sexual violence and I appreciate all of the support I have received
from the group. The participants in the Journeys in World Politics workshop (2011), led
by Sara Mitchell and Kelly Kadera, read and commented on an early draft of this project
and offered helpful insights on areas for improvement.
I am grateful for the material support that allowed me to conduct research and set
aside time to write. The American Political Science Association Centennial Center’s Rita
Mae Kelly Endowment Fellowship provided assistance for my research in New York.
The Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation’s Dissertation Fellowship in
Women’s Studies and the George Washington University’s Summer Dissertation
Fellowship supported summertime writing. The Global Gender Program at the Elliott
School of International Affairs provided, through its pre-doctoral fellowship, an
opportunity to research, think, write, and become part of a dynamic community of
scholars.
To the named and anonymous individuals who shared their time and experiences
to inform this project and shape the central argument—thank you. I was fortunate to have
the opportunity to meet incredible women and men who devote each day to ending the
scourge of sexual and gender-based violence.
The late Lt. Col. Shannon Beebe eagerly assisted the pursuit of an answer to my
research question. His belief in the project’s importance, from our very first conversation
about it, has stayed with me even in his absence and it is my hope that he would have
been proud of the final product and the questions it raises.
My family deserves and has my deepest appreciation. Ray and Pam Crawford
instilled in their daughter a desire to read, write, learn, ask questions, oppose injustice,
and challenge the status quo. Their love and encouragement made me who I am. My
amazing husband, Tyler Belling, patiently accepted marathon studying and writing
sessions, kept a steady supply of jellybeans and chocolate in the house, and remained my
rock through all the ups and downs of the dissertation life-cycle.

I would like to thank Jenny ‘Bee’ Holder for her unwavering support and encouragement.
Without Jenny’s time, energy, patience and advice, this thesis would never have been completed.
I would like to thank my family for their constant support in all my endeavors including my
graduate school journey. In particular, I would like to thank my father posthumously for
instilling his work ethic and from whom I inherited my forthright character, which enables me to
address social injustice on a daily basis. I would also like to thank my mother, who continues to
support my ideas, no matter how unconventional and for all her love. Knowing that I could call
or come home at any time is the very foundation of all my life successes. I would like to thank
Sir Max Clancey for his moral support in the final year of writing.
I would like to thank my colleagues, Kerry Porth and Lisa Gibson, for enhancing my
understandings of the topics discussed in this thesis over the past several years.
I would like to thank Milena Johnson and Mary Stocks for listening and providing much
guidance and support.
Finally, I would like to express gratitude and appreciation to my committee. I would like to
thank Dr. Leslie Brown for signing on at a critical point and directing my timely completion in a
very supportive and professional manner. And finally much thanks and appreciation to Dr.
Annalee Lepp, who believed I could produce a quality thesis from the seed of an idea three years
ago and for sticking with me, through what was at times a very challenging process.

I owe a deep debt of gratitude to my adviser, Naomi Leonard, for being a mentor,
guide, teacher and colleague throughout my time at Princeton. When I arrived here
I knew that I wanted to use nature as a source of inspiration for control and robotic
applications, but I was very short on the details. Naomi showed me how to channel
a sense of wonder about the natural world into practical and tractable problems and
then how to use those problems to gain insight into the real world. None of the work
presented here would have occurred without her guidance. Moreover, she gave me
the freedom to pursue my own ideas while knowing, much better than I did, where
I was going and how my work connected to the broader ﬁeld. Many of my most
enlightening and productive hours at Princeton were spent in meetings with Naomi
and I hope that when I leave, I can carry with me some of the passion and dedication
I have learned from her.
All of the work in this dissertation was carried out, to varying degrees, in collaboration with others. In particular, Luca Scardovi was instrumental in getting me
started in my investigations and introducing me to eﬀective resistance. Additionally,
Andrea Cavagna and Irene Giardina generously shared their starling data with me
and oﬀered enormous insight into the analysis of physical systems.
My committee members, Phil Holmes and Simon Levin, have supported me in
many diﬀerent ways over the years. Their classes gave me a much deeper appreciation
of the power and complexities of dynamical systems, and their assistance and advice
has helped me to broaden the scope of my work. Finally, I greatly appreciate their
time and care in reading my dissertation and providing feedback to improve it.
All of the graduate students and postdocs in the Leonard lab have made innumerable contributions to both my work and my life. Ben, Dan, Andy, Kendra, Darren,
Stephanie, Tian, Paul, Katie, Will, Brendan, Luca, Carlos, Ioannis, Alex and Vaibhav have all provided me with advice, feedback, camaraderie and friendship. It has
also been a pleasure for me to work with several undergraduate or newly graduated
students. In helping Kelsey, Alex, Aman and Doris with their projects, I have been
able to widen my outlook and learn from their ideas and perspectives.
One of the many wonderful aspects of my experience at Princeton has been the
opportunities for cross-disciplinary communication and collaboration. In particular,
I would like to thank the members of the Couzin lab, the Levin lab and the Project
6 team for sharing their fascinating work.
The Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering department has been a second family
to me and has greatly enriched my life both academically and non-academically. No
acknowledgement would be complete with thanking Jill Ray and Jess O’Leary for
their tireless work in all aspects of keeping this family together. The other PhD
students who started in MAE with me - Abdel, Anand, Brandt, Dan, Elizabeth,
Fujia, Johnny, Jonathan, Justin, Owen, Parthav, Peter, Thanh, Tian and Yu-Cheng
- formed the most incredible group of people I could imagine to share this ride. There
are too many other wonderful people in the department to name them all, but I want
to give special thanks to the MAE softball and soccer teams for all they added to my
experiences here.
Outside of my work, I have had the privilege of meeting many incredible people
during my time here, particularly at the Graduate College and at Princeton United
Methodist Church. Their friendship will be deeply missed when I leave.
My family has been a constant source of inspiration and support for me through
the many good and few hard times. My parents, Forrest and Sandra, allowed me to
dream of being whatever I wanted to be, and then provided me with everything I
needed to turn that dream into a reality. My siblings, Elizabeth, John and Rosemary
have shared so much of my life with me, even as we have all followed our separate
paths. In addition, my new family, Richard, D’Ann and Jo have welcomed me as one
of their own.
Finally, I would like to express my deepest gratitude and steadfast love to my
wonderful wife Elizabeth. She has given me so much more than I ever expected to
ﬁnd when I made the journey over to the USA. Every facet of my work and life is
enriched by her love, her understanding and her support.
This dissertation carries the number T-3274 in the records of the Department of
Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering.
For my parents and my wife.

This dissertation was written during (and, in some cases, was an eyewitness to) a
particularly important, but volatile period in the political and social history of the Middle
East and the Muslim world. The Arab Spring, which began approximately a year after I
defended my dissertation prospectus, significantly changed the political makeup of the
region as well as Islam’s role in this process. During my initial “soak and poke” trip to
the region in 2009, I was very late for a scheduled appointment at an Egyptian library
when then-President Mubarak’s motorcade closed down several major Cairo streets.
Conversely, parts of the conclusion chapter were written with the sound of protests and
gunfire in the background during Egypt’s tumultuous summer of 2013. In many ways,
these unexpected twists and turns forced me to always consider what about the region
(and Islam’s role in regional politics) is new and what has remained the same.
In acknowledging those who helped me in completing this long process, I must
first and foremost thank my family and friends. Without their constant love and support,
I would never have made it this far toward my lifelong dream of earning a Ph.D. As
mentioned on the previous page, this project is dedicated to them. I would also like to
thank all of the teachers I have had throughout my life who have taught me to love the
social sciences, especially my high school teachers Mr. Russ Cannon and Mr. David
Osiecki and my college professors Dr. Brian Ripley and Dr. Michael Federici.
I would also like to thank my dissertation committee at George Washington
University, especially my advisor, Marc Lynch, for all of their patience in dealing with
someone who was finishing their dissertation part-time while also contending with a full
plate of other responsibilities. I would also like to thank the Institute of Middle East
Studies at George Washington University for a travel grant to help me undertake a short
research trip to the region in 2009.
Finally, I would like to thank all of my colleagues (at GW and elsewhere) who
helped me conceptualize this project, gave me practical advice on various aspects or
questions related to it, or read one or more of the many drafts.

The author would like to express appreciation to her dissertation committee members, Dr.
Clint Robertson (Chair) and to Dr. Amy Patrick. They patiently nudged her to reign in the topic
to a manageable design. Dr. Ruth Norman continuously reminded her that the project should be
discovery and analysis driven, not opinionated. Dr. Don Durandetta cheered her on from the first
day she met him and began her educational journey with Wilmington University. She is
especially grateful to Dr. Patrick for her assistance in limiting and refining the research questions
and for advising and examining the development of the instruments, and the interpretation of the
data.
Without the support of Bishop David Bernard of the United Pentecostal Church
International, this project would have not been possible. His energy and interest in the topic was
the driving force that gave the inertia to launch the research project. The author also would like
to thank K. C. , Jo and Judi at K. C. Associates for their work. K. C.’s guidance, support, and
enthusiasm throughout this project was indispensable. A huge expression of gratitude goes to
Diana Gillespie for her support and tutoring through the maze of statistics courses during all
those senior moments. The adult children, Anthony and Jeanette, were the cheerleading team, the
husband, Wayne provided the support, and the grandchildren provided the joy along the way.

I particularly appreciate Dr. Steven Chapra for introducing me to the power of numerical
modeling and my fascination with it. Thanks to Dr. Richard Vogel who have offered precious
insight for both this study and my career as have all my thesis committee members.
I would also like to thank Dr. James Limbrunner and my classmates Jeff Walker and Jing
Zhu for their knowledge and experiences on numerical model development, GIS application and
other technical issues. Thanks to my colleagues and friends in CEE department and WSSS
