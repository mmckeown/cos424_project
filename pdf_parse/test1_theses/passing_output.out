Acknowledgements

dissertation and are too numerous to mention individually, so to all of you I wish to
express my gratitude. I would like to acknowledge my wife Shelia, whose selfless
patience, love and support cannot be rewarded with mere words. My parents Leroy and
Ruth whose love, understanding, and support have been unwavering throughout the
process. To my daughter Elizabeth and son Jonathon, your understanding and support as
valuable family time was consumed by the requirements of work and study. I must go on
to thank my committee chair, Dr. Robin Throne, who kept me focused with critical
feedback, direction, wisdom and understanding in times o f frustration and elation.

First and foremost, I would like to thank my mentor, Dr. Regina Santella. She took a gamble on me,
taking me in as an orphaned technician during my Master’s degree, and then again, suggesting I
continue my tenure in the lab as a doctoral student. My decision to apply was largely shaped by her
example as a role model of a woman who forged a successful career in this field while maintaining the
ability to balance her work and family life. As a mentor, her door has always been open to me, as well
as all other students who have passed through her class and lab. Despite her hectic schedule through
the many hats she wears, she has always taken the time to provide feedback ranging from
experimental protocol, written drafts and career paths. Her guidance throughout my time in the lab has
been invaluable.
I would like to thank my additional committee members, Dr. Greg Freyer, Dr. Mary Gamble, Dr. Jeanine
Genkinger and Dr. Mary Beth Terry for taking the time and effort to meet with me and provide me with
feedback throughout this process.

This work would not have been possible without the support of fellow Santella lab members, past and
present. I would especially like to mention Qiao Wang, who in addition to having worked with me sideby-side through all these years, teaching me invaluable skills on the bench, has been one of my closest
friends and leading member of my lab-mom squad, supported by other core facility members, Iryna
Sirosh and Irina Gurvich. I would like to thank Gail Garbowski for readily attending to administrative
needs, ensuring among other things that all necessary supplies were always readily available, and to
our lab manager, Irina Gurvich, for providing me with all necessary database-related information. I am
also grateful to the advice I received from post-doctoral fellows past and present in our lab, including
Hui-Chen Wu, Lissette Delgado-Cruzata, Jennifer Zipprich and Hulya Yazici.
I would like to thank the cohort of EHS students who have been part of my experience during my
tenure here. I would especially like to thank Maria Rosa, Megan Niedzwiecki, Nada Hamade, Allan
Just, Rob Prins, Caitlin Howe, Tiffany Sanchez and Brandilyn Peters for their feedback and fellowship.
I feel honored to count you among my peers.
Finally, I would like to thank my parents, for the sacrifices they made in coming to this country to
provide my sister and I the opportunities we had to pursue our passions and interests. I would like to
thank my sister, Cynthia, for being my voice of reason. And, M, for the steady supply of prized Butter
Kekse and IT support.
