Thank you to my wonderful husband for supporting me and encouraging me
throughout my entire journey of graduate school. Your presence in my life and the life we
are building together has been a great motivator for me to complete this project and earn my
master’s degree. For this and so many other reasons, I love you more than words can
express.
To my parents, thank you for always providing me with unconditional love,
acceptance, and support. I am the person I am because of you and because of the great
upbringing you gave me. The moral compass you instilled in me navigates my life and the
pride you have in me continues to drive me to achieve my goals. Without you I would not
have had the confidence or the opportunity to attend graduate school and develop the means
to help others, and for this I will always be grateful.
To all of my fabulous friends, thank you for standing by me and understanding when
I would disappeared for months at a time to complete reading assignments, papers, and this
project. The love, support, and fun times you have given me over the years are priceless and
will never be forgotten.
To my canine child, thank you for lay next to me hour after hour while I did school
work and continuously providing me with unconditional love. You are the best puppy ever, I
am grateful that I was able to adopt you.
Deborah, thank you for introducing me to the creative art therapies, because of the
knowledge you gave me I will continue to integrate alternative forms of therapy into my
clinical work. Thank you for being my reader on this project and providing me with
encouragement and guidance, your third set of eyes made this paper perfect.
Colette, you have been an amazing mentor, motivator, and instructor to me
throughout my career at Saint Mary’s, for this I will always remain eternally grateful to you.
Without your guidance and encouragement on this project I may not have completed it in
time to reach my goal of graduating in May 2013. I greatly appreciate you and the work you
do both at Saint Mary’s and abroad. You were my instructor for two of the most important
courses of my academic career and for this I feel very lucky. Knowing you helped to shape
me into a better student, clinician, and person, thank you.

Upon entering the PhD program, I was warned that getting married during the first
semester would be too much. Nothing could have been further from the truth. A wedding is just a
day; a marriage is a lifetime, and I certainly could not have completed this program without my
wife. Listing all the ways Kathleen made this possible would require an additional chapter and
trivialize the love and commitment she has shown me. most importantly, she provided daily
affirmation that I was exactly where I should be and doing exactly what I should be doing. It
truly was a team effort.
Apart from Kathleen, two people are most responsible for my success in the program.
Glenn Richey took me under his wing from the start. He was the professor I had in mind when I
decided to pursue a PhD, and he was the professor I tried to emulate throughout my four years.
Not only did he shape my research and teaching, he introduced me to the study abroad program
in Istanbul and the study domestic program at Office B. Adam Rapp arrived in Tuscaloosa
exactly halfway through my time in Tuscaloosa, but he quickly became an indispensable mentor.
He prepared me for the job market and the dissertation, and showed me that you could
accomplish a lot while still having a nIce time. Both Adam and Glenn have become friends, for
which I feel blessed. Most doctoral students have one ally, one advocate, one true role model; I
can proudly say that I have two.
I also want to acknowledge my dissertation committee. Kristy Reynolds was my
introduction into the PhD program and has been a part it of every step of the way. While she has
informed my research and teaching, I most value her example of how to strike the work-life
balance. From the moment I asked him to be on my committee, Craig Armstrong warned that he
would ‘push back” on my research. He has lived up to his word and for that I am grateful. It also
helps to know someone who could beat Google Scholar in a draw. Clark Midkiff brought muchneeded perspective to my research and always asked the question that sparked a discussion. I
asked John Peloza to join my committee because I loved his research, and he proved that there is
a strong correlation between good research and good people. While not on my committee, I have
to acknowledge Sharon Beatty. From the first emoticon-filled email four years ago, she has
offered encouragement and positive feedback.
I am especially grateful to the marketing doctoral cohort at UA. From happy hours and
Beer Olympics to marathon homework sessions and “Can I use your class for data?” the students
– past and present – have made this whole thing not just manageable but [at times] enjoyable. A
handful deserves special attention. Myles Landers helped me run models in Bidgood and trails at
Sokol Park. William Northington kept me young, Stephanie Gillison kept me in line, and Tyler
Morgan kept me laughing; each provided real friendship at different times in the program. Frank
Adams wore many hats, including friend, colleague, mentor, and counselor. The best way to
thank him is to be for someone else what he was for me.
Lastly, I want to thank my family and friends for their support along the way. Leaving
Pennsylvania for Alabama raised some eyebrows, but several visits (and national championships)
later, our loved ones have come to see that this was the right decision.

First and foremost, I have to thank God. I could not have completed this process
without my faith and constant prayer. I also would like to thank, Dr. Mark DeVirgilio,
chairperson of my dissertation committee, for his support, time, feedback, advice, sense
of humor, sincerity, and guidance. Dr. DeVirgilio’s encouragement and dedication was
instrumental in my success. I would also like to thank my committee member, Dr. Lori
Demeter for all of her invaluable feedback and assistance in helping me complete this
process. I am also very grateful to Dr. Wendy Andberg, Walden University’s Institutional
Review Board, and the Walden University Writing Center because without their help and
honest feedback, I would not have made it this far.
In addition to the individuals mentioned above, I have to thank all of family and
friends. Although when a person lists names, some people are always left out, I have to
give a sincere thanks to my mother Constance Russell, my brother Justin Conerly, my
great friends Traci Champion and Pamela Williams, friends and coworkers Teresa
Dugger, Daryle Clark, Buffy Dunnaville, and last but not least, my cousins Valerine
Conerly and Dr. Rhonda Conerly Holliday. These individuals listened to me constantly
talk about my dissertation and vent, prayed for me, offered advice, made me laugh,
encouraged me to take breaks and enjoy life, and understood all of the times I had to take
off work, cancel plans, and miss events. Your support and encouragement will never be
forgotten. I could not have done this without you all.

I wish to express my extreme gratitude to everyone who supported me
throughout my graduate studies. My adviser, Dr. Jason Dahl, always had his
door open, ready and willing to answer any questions I may have had, intelligent or lack thereof. More importantly, he shared with me his passion for Ocean
Engineering and constantly turned my frustrations around into constructive optimism. The members of my committee also deserve great thanks. Dr. Stephen
Licht enthusiastically welcomed all quests for abbreviated lessons from his first
day with the department. Dr. Richard Vaccaro, from the Electrical Engineering
Department, is an amazing professor who gave me different points of view on the
engineering world with every lecture I attended.
I am especially grateful for the love and support from my fiance, Jeff. Regardless of how overwhelmed I became, he continuously reminded me of my strengths
and power of mind. It was a pleasure to attend the entire six years of my college career with him by my side, books open, and constantly bouncing ideas and
concepts off of one another.
Much appreciation is extended to my friends and family who unintentionally
have carried me through this experience. Thank you Michelle, Mary, Jenn, and
Regina, for listening to my rants on my research and TA duties. Without you all,
I would have run out of caffeine and not been my cheerful self.
I am dedicating this thesis to my parents, Rita and Stephen. Since the day I
was born, they encouraged my love for learning and experiencing new things. They
always made me feel like I could change the world and were a constant reminder
that along with them, God was always by my side.

In my two-years of graduate study, I have received much help which has guided
me through all the difficulties and made me grow up. This help has not only solved my
problems, but will also be beneficial for me for the rest of my life. First and foremost,
I would like to thank my parents, who are always there listening to me and supporting
me. Your love and trust are always my strongest motivation to fight for a better and
happier life for you and me. I would also like to thank my ex-girlfriend, who has spent
more than three years loving and supporting me.
In addition, I would like to thank my advisor, Dr. Michael White, who not only
patiently guided me in a research area I had no experience in before, but also has always
been very considerate about my research and daily life and has given me a lot of
precious advice. I would also like to thank my committee members, Dr. JoséRodriguez
and Dr. Jiangyong Jia for your valuable instruction on my research and scientific talk.
Besides, as my compatriot and a lovable senior graduate student, Yixiong Yang has not
only taught me all the important knowledge in the lab, but also pulled me out from the
emotional whirlpool and made me stronger, which I will be grateful for my whole life.
I would also like to thank Dr. Jia Zhou and Dr. Miki Nakayama for all of your help on
my research, Danielle Nerko for your assistance in experiments and writing, Joe Magee
for your humorous and smart talking, Pan Xu, Fang Xu and Si Luo for all the happiness
with you and all the group members for everything I have learned in the past year.

I would like to express my gratitude to my supervisors Dr. A. Hussein and Dr.
S. Nkurunziza. I want to thank them for valuable comments and suggestions. They
supported me both with choosing the research direction and overcoming the technical
issues. Also they gave me the opportunities to work independently which allowed me
to learn a lot of material from different fields of Mathematics and Statistics and
improve the problem solving skills.
Also I want to thank University of Windsor, Department of Mathematics and
Statistics and my supervisors for providing me with Research and Graduate Assistantships. This financial support allowed me to concentrate on studying and finish
my program at this wonderful university.
I also want to thank my friends in Canada who supported me during the whole
year and showed me the Canadian traditions and sights.
And I want to thank my wife very much for her invaluable contribution into my
life. She constantly supported and helped me with any difficulties and problems
which I encountered since we met. She was always there for me when I needed it
and I learned a lot of important things from her. Her support allowed me to come to
Canada and successfully finish my study and I believe it will help me to succeed in
future.

There have been many people who have helped in one way or another in the
completion of this thesis. I have tried to mention these individuals specifically; however
this is not an exhaustive list. Without the help, guidance, and advice of all of the people
listed below I would not be where I am today, and I am very grateful and humbled by all
of the support I have received over the years.
The story of my academic research career begins back at Mount Allison
University. Here I made the decision to ultimately pursue an Honours degree in
Chemistry, not truly realizing what that entailed. I am very grateful for Dr. Stephen Duffy
for being beyond accommodating, to teach Chem. 4521 – Environmental Chemistry in
his office to me one on one, and for suggesting that I should strive to do an honours
research project with Dr. Steve Westcott. Lucky for me, Old Man Westcott was willing to
take a chance on a 3rd year student who was still trying to figure his life out. In his “Wild
Toads” research group I truly discovered the passion that I have for research, and how
rewarding teaching others can be from the Saturday Toads. I was fortunate to also
perform a special topics research project with Dr. Adrian Culf. Both these experiences
made me realize that graduate school was a definite possibility. I am also grateful for the
other members of not only the Chemistry department at Mount Allison, but also the
biochemistry and biology department for their help, guidance, and expertise throughout
my undergraduate career. I will never forget these experiences and always look back with
fondness at my time spent at Mount A.
To begin my graduate career, I began by contacting professors in Canada who
were doing research that was interesting to me. Luckily, my first choice, Dr. Charles
Walsby, was willing to give the kid from a small East Coast town a chance. Coming from
Sackville, New Brunswick to Burnaby, British Columbia was a culture shock to say the
least, but with the help of Dr. Walsby and his research group the transition was seamless.
Over the next 5 years, not only did a very productive partnership form, but also a
friendship. I am extremely grateful to Charles for accepting me into his group and giving
me the opportunity to succeed. I was also fortunate during my time at SFU to make
several lasting friendships with not only members of the Walsby group, but within the
Chemistry department and even outside the university. Beginning with the Walsby group,
I would like to thank Naniye Cetinbas who was extremely helpful in guiding me during
my first few months at SFU, Qi He (Tommy) who was a pleasure to be around both in
and out of the lab, Changhua Mu for all the helpful discussions and for staying late the
occasional night to take my samples out of the incubator (you were a life saver!), and
Stephanie Chang for your helpful critiques and questions in preparing me for my thesis
defence. I also would like to thank the undergraduate students who have helped me over
the years on a variety of projects, in chronological order: Jonathan Jiang, Jackie
Williams, Haley Mitchell, Ryan Chard, Yaser Al-Jobory, Boris Wu, Thalia Jang, and
Micah Brush. They were instrumental in completing many of the projects that were made
into publications, and for that I am very grateful. In the Chemistry department there are
several good friendships that I was fortunate to make, primarily with members in the
Centre of Excellence in Inorganic Chemistry, commonly known as the Leznoff and Storr
groups. I would like to thank, Dr. Edwin Wong for having the patience to teach me how
to solve an X-ray crystal structure, and also Dr. Michael Katz for helping me (and Edwin)
solve the most troublesome structures. I would like to thank Michael Jones for helping
run and work-up cyclic voltammograms for several of my compounds, and Frank
Haftbaradaran for running countless elemental analysis samples for me. Additionally, I
would also like to thank all the members of the Chemistry department at SFU for helping
me as a student, teaching assistant, and president of the graduate caucus. Outside of the
university, I was fortunate to be a member of a 3 on γ hockey team, the “Fighting Irish”
where I have made several lasting friendships, and was able to escape the confines of the
lab for a few hours every week. Everyone listed above were all positive influences in my
life, and their support was greatly appreciated and will not be forgotten.
In preparing for my thesis submission, I am very thankful to my committee
members Dr. Paul Percival and Dr. Tim Storr. Their expertise, experience, and guidance
have helped me develop into the scientist that I am today. For my thesis defence I am also
grateful for my internal and external examiners, Dr. Dipankar Sen and Dr. Jürgen Gailer
respectively. For them, in addition to my committee members, to take time out of their
day to read my thesis and offer helpful suggestions on ways to improve it, I am very
grateful.
Last, but certainly not least, I am extremely grateful for my family and all of their
love and support. It begins at home, and it is safe to say that no one has been more
unconditionally supportive of me in everything that I do than my loving wife Adrienne.
Coming home to her and the dogs (Kao and Baylen) has been the highlight of several of
my days, and helped me get through the tough times, in particular, writing this very
thesis. Without them in my life I would not be as happy as I am now. At my home away
from home, now in Ottawa, Ontario, my mother and father have also been highly
supportive of me, both emotionally and financially. To my siblings, Matthew, Deanna,
Mark, Denise, and Rory, I am thankful for your support, and curiosity as to what I was
doing at SFU through the years. Also, to my new family, Dr. Ron, Jutta, and Erin Skitch,
I am thankful for their love and support through the years. I am also grateful to members
of my extended family for all of their support, encouragement, and prayers.

We choose to go to the moon in this decade and to do these other things
not because they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal
will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills,
because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are
unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win.
—President John F. Kennedy
Come, my friends,
’Tis not too late to seek a newer world.
Push off, and sitting well in order smite
The sounding furrows; for my purpose holds
To sail beyond the sunset, and the baths
Of all the western stars, until I die.
It may be that the gulfs will wash us down;
It may be we shall touch the Happy Isles,
And see the great Achilles, whom we knew.
Though much is taken, much abides; and though
We are not now that strength which in old days
Moved earth and heaven, that which we are, we are,
One equal temper of heroic hearts,
Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will
To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.
—Lord Alfred Tennyson’s Ulysses
This thesis is dedicated to my father, Edward Ruberry, who resolutely
seeks and accepts the greatest challenges.
From his son, Mike.

When I chose to make música típica popular the subject of my doctoral research in
late 2005, I knew I was taking a leap of faith. I had never been to Panama, my aural
familiarity with the music was minimal and scholarship on the topic was pretty much
nonexistent. For these reasons, writing a research proposal (a condition of my being able to
travel to Panama and begin fieldwork in earnest) became an unexpectedly arduous
undertaking. It was at this time that I had the overwhelming feeling that I was going at it
alone. Fortunately, I couldn’t have been more mistaken and in fact, researching for this study
became one of my most social experiences to date. The following is but a small token of my
gratitude to a great number of people who, in many and varying capacities, have helped me
realize this dissertation.
This project simply would have not been possible without the help, support, and
guidance of my dissertation advisors and committee members. I would like to thank my
supervisor James Kippen for his steadfast support and confidence in my work. Among the
many things I learned from him was a respect and consideration for the sound dimension of
any musical practice. Throughout the process of researching for and writing this dissertation,
I have endeavoured to take this particular advice to heart and I believe my work and
(ethno)musical experience has been considerably enriched for it. My co-supervisor Jeff
Packman became a presence at U of T approximately halfway into my study. His intellect,
prodigious knowledge of Latin American music and related scholarly concerns, and, perhaps
most importantly, devotion to his students immediately endeared him to me. As my
dissertation drew nearer to completion, Packman assumed an ever greater role in shaping this
project (always for the better, of course) as well as my own thinking as an academic. For that
and so many other things too numerous to list here, I owe him a great deal of gratitude.
T.M. Scruggs, Joshua Pilzer and Ken McLeod formed part of a defense committee
that a doctoral student could only dream of. Their feedback not only served to improve the
document, but also provided a source of wisdom and guidance that will serve me well into
the future.
My decision to study música típica popular can largely be credited to Lucho De
Sedas who, along with his wife Leda De Sedas Amaranto and son Juan Diego, not only
introduced me to conjunto music, but also provided me with my initial contacts in Panama.
Throughout the course of my research I benefited immensely from the high regard in which
Lucho is held among his conjunto peers and Panamanians at large. I feel priviledged that I
can call Don Lucho a personal friend, informant and teacher.
I am grateful to Rodolfo “Fósforo” Jaén and his wife Yadira who provided me with
my first ‘home-base’ in Panama and took me to my first bailes where I experienced the
awesome beauty and power of música típica popular for the first time.
Relationships best described as that of a ‘second family’ are often reported among
researchers working far from home and I, thankfully, am no exception. Mine are the Jaén
Cano family, which include Jorge (Sr.), Maria, Dorissabeth Ariza, Jorge (Jr.) and “Javier”
(also Jorge [Jr.]). When I first moved to Las Tablas it was they who took me into their home
and eventually (and only on my insistence) set me up with my own house some doors down
from theirs. It is with incredible fondness that I remember the many meals we shared
together and long conversations we had. The eldest son, Jorge Jaén (cited frequently
throughout this dissertation) became not only a dear friend, but also one of my most
important musical ‘guides’ and teachers. Muchisima gracias mi hermano.
This study benefited greatly from the trust and confidence of a very large number of
conjunto practitioners to tell the story of their music and the lives they lead to realize it.
Dorindo Cárdenas and the members of his legendary conjunto, El Orgullo Santeño were
among the first conjunto professionals I came to know. Their conviviality and indefatigable
camaraderie—even during the more trying moments of conjunto work—remain among some
of the most important learning experiences and joy-filled memories of my fieldwork tenure. I
would also like to thank the dueños and integrantes of numerous conjuntos who took me
under their wing, gave me lifts when I needed them, and ultimately entrusted me with the
responsibility of sharing the more glamorous, often private and at times arduous aspects of
their chosen profession. Special thanks is due to Victorio “Toyito” Vergara, Manuel
“Nenito” Vargas and Los Plumas Negras; Ulpiano Vergara, Ulpiano “Panito,” Dania Maria
and Los Distinguidos; Osvaldo Ayala and Ritmo Santeño; Samy and Sandra Sandoval and
Los Patrones de la Cumbia; and Alfredo Escudero and Los Montañeros; Eráclides Amaya
and El Orgullo de la Montaña; Maximino “Chimino” Moreno and El Orgullo Tonosíeño;
Vladimir Atencio and Grupo Manantial de Amor; José Olmedo Pérez and El Simpatía
Musical; and Los Ermanos Flacos.
Other notable stalwarts of the conjunto tradition who contributed greatly to my
understanding of música típica popular include Ceferino Nieto, Roberto “Papi” Brandao,
Eduardo “Balito” Chan, Victorino “Nano” Córdoba, Fito Espino, Simon Saavedra, Abdiel
Nuñez, Kenny Alexander Pérez, Jorge Aquiles Domínguez, Serafina “Serín” Barrios,
Roberto Carlos Castillo, Miguel Angel Vergara, Jorge Luis Gómez Vargas (Balbinito to his
friends), Christian Cedeño, Carlos “Jerez” Donoso, Ceferino “Kako” Nieto, Eliezar “Piro”
Vergara, Celso “Celsito” Quintero, Aceves Nuñez and the members of Los Juglares,
Christian Quintero, Kevin Mata, Oscar Poveda, and Miguel Jaén Herrera (Q.D.E.P.). To all
of you past, present and future conjunteras and conjunteros, this dissertation is but a small
token of my respect and admiration. ¡Ajaua!
As a graduate student at the University of Toronto’s music faculty, I was fortunate to
have studied with a number of great teachers and scholars who had a hand in shaping my
development as a researcher and academic in the most positive of ways. In particular, I wish
to thank Gage Averill and Robin Elliott who offered much sound advice in the early stages of
this project. I am also grateful to Annette Sanger who provided valuable feedback and
support throughout my Ph.D. studies. At U of T I also came into contact with a fantastic
group of fellow graduate students who provided me with a community of engaged
ethnomusicologists with whom I could share my ideas, concerns and experiences. In
particular, I would like to thank Catherine Gauthier-Mercier and Meghan Forsyth who were
regular sounding boards throughout my doctoral studies, and whose research topics often
offered productive synchronicities with my own. Also I wish to acknowledge help and
support of Parmela Attariwala, Stephanie Conn, Andrew Hillhouse, Mark Laver, Chris
Wilson, Julian Humphries, Kate Galloway and Carolyn Ramzy.
Numerous other academic colleagues and unofficial ‘advisors’ have helped me
throughout the research and writing process. I would especially like to thank fellow
Panamanianist Francesca Riviera, who offered her extensive knowledge on Panamanian
musical practices generously and without reservation. Francesca is an exemplary academic
and colleague, and (as should be clear to the reader) her ideas on Panamanian musical
historiography have influenced my own thinking considerably. I am also grateful to
Panamanian historian Mario García Hudson who provided much needed guidance
particularly in areas of Panamanian popular musical history.
Studying in Toronto put me in touch with a number of dedicated researchers and
academics from whom I often sought advice at various stages of this project. In particular I
would like to acknowledge the help and support I received from Ruben Esguerra, Annemarie
Gallaugher, Alberto Munarriz, Gillian Turnbull, Gerry McGoldrick, Gordon Sheard, Brigido
Galvan, Michael Marcuzzi, Judith Cohen, Danielle Robinson and Kim Chow-Morris.
Special thanks are also due to my brothers Jeremy and Samuel Bellaviti who
followed my work closely offered valuable feedback when needed; and to Alessandra Da
Rocha, Eliana Cuevas and José Ortega for their help in realizing critical (and sometimes
tricky) translation work.
Toronto’s salsa community not only offered me respite from the challenges of
doctoral study, but also provided me with a group of expert teachers and advisors in areas of
Latin American music and expressive cultures. I especially would like to thank Luis
“Luisito” Orbegoso, Daniel Stone, Paco Luviano, Alex Naar, Rosendo Chendy León (Sr.),
Rosendo Chendy León (Jr.), Jeremy Ledbetter and Jose Ortega for providing me with critical
insights into various aspects of conjunto music and practice, and the folks at Lula Lounge
who provided the staging grounds for many memorable performances.
Finally, I wish to thank my friends and family for their love and support. For my
immediate family who gave me their unconditional love and encouragement at every stage of
this project. For my extended family who maintained an active interest in my work and
provided support along the way. And to Alessandra whose love and patience during the
critical final stages of this Ph.D. is something I will deeply cherish. Gracias.

I would like to thank my mother, father and sister, who have supported me through my
entire education by continually providing me with encouragement. Although it has sometimes
been a struggle your unconditional support has helped me see my true abilities and that I can do
anything that I set my mind to do.
I would like to thank the greatest colleagues in the world who provided me with support
and feedback with my thesis. You all make me strive to become a better teacher every day. To
my students thank you for taking part in this study and making teaching everyday exciting.
To Aunt Jo, thank you so much for providing financial support to help me afford
Graduate School. Now we will both be Caldwell College alumni.
Finally I would like to thank my advisor, Dr. Lawson, whose guidance, advice and
direction made what I once thought impossible, become a reality.
