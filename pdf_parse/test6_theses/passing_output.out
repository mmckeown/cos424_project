I would like to express my deepest gratitude to the members of my dissertation
committee: Donal Byard, Carol Marquardt, Yinghua Li, and Emanuel Zur. Professor Byard has
mentored me through the doctoral process and his guidance has been invaluable. I am deeply
grateful to Professors Byard and Marquardt for countless hours spent making this dissertation a
reality. They both have instilled in me a critical approach to research and a new way of thinking
about my work. I can already see how this approach is vital to a career in research and
navigation of the peer review process. I am also grateful to Yinghua Li for her insightful
critiques of my work. Her insight and participation as a committee member has been immensely
helpful. Finally, I am deeply grateful to Emanuel Zur for his tireless efforts in guiding me in my
research. It was his initial suggestion and insights which lead me to an interest in debt
contracting research.
I would also like to thank the faculty and staff at Baruch College. Specifically, I would
like to thank my co-authors, Joseph Weintrop and Paquita Davis-Friday. Professor Weintrop has
guided and mentored me through multiple projects and his careful insights have been priceless.
Professor Davis-Friday has also mentored me through not only this doctoral program and our coauthored work, but also the MBA program I completed before beginning my doctoral studies.
Without her guidance, I likely would never have considered a doctoral program. I am deeply
grateful to both of these faculty members.
I am also grateful for the feedback I received on this paper, specifically for comments
from Edward Li, Linda Allen, Hans Christensen, Christian Leuz, Dongkuk Lim, and Brigitte
Muehlmann.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
What nineteenth-century readers knew well was that all texts contain multiple influential
presences, and I am pleased to say that this dissertation is no different. I am privileged to have
had the most supportive, patient, and insightful dissertation committee imaginable. I thank my
advisor Ross Posnock for being an encyclopedia of academic research, directing me to the
scholarship that has most impacted my thinking, for his careful and generous reading and
commenting on my drafts, and for his incredible patience, understanding, and never failing
encouragement. I thank Sharon Marcus for making me a better writer (I still have much to learn
from her), for her perspicacity in seeing my project more clearly than I did, for her always spoton advice both on my scholarship and professional development, and for going out of her way to
support me. I thank Lisa Gordis who has been instrumental in my formation as a scholar and a
person, who first taught me to love early American literature, without whose encouragement I
would not have even dreamed of graduate school, and whose confidence in my ideas slowly but
surely helped me to develop my own.
My heartfelt thanks go to Meredith McGill, whose scholarship has been so influential for
this dissertation in particular and my thinking more generally, for her generous feedback with
which to continue to develop this project as well as to T. Austin Graham for opening my eyes to
more terrain for historical inquiry in this project.
I thank Ezra Tawil, Jenny Davidson, the rest of the Eighteenth-Century Reading Group,
with whom I was able to discuss the beginnings of this project, for their helpful advice and
questions. I would also like to thank Gerald Cloud who helped me with my research on John
Bartlett and the American publication history of silver-fork novels, as well as William Delgado
at the Hispanic Society of America for his help with the Revista de la Habana.

iii

I thank all the professors I have had the honor to learn from here for being models of
outstanding scholarship and teaching for emulation: Amanda Claybaugh, Julie Crawford,
Michael Golston, Wen Jin, Shayne Legassie, Edward Mendelson, Julie Peters, Victoria Rosner,
Clifford Siskin, Maura Spiegel, Gauri Viswanathan, and Nicole Wallack.
Thank you to all the scholars whose work I have quoted or referenced in this dissertation.
Many thanks, too, to all my fellow graduate students in the department who have
recommended books, commiserated and advised. I thank my classmates in Professor Marcus’s
article workshop for helping me to sort out my Bartlett research, and in particular, Olivia Moy
and Jangwook Huh for their help and friendship. I am incredibly grateful and indebted to the
consultants at the Writing Center, especially Katie McIntyre, without whom I might never have
been able to pull off the final draft.
Last, but by no means least, I thank my friends and family. Thanks to my friends from
Coliseum Books, especially Mike Lindgren, Ron Kolm, and Conrad Brenner, for discussions on
my dissertation texts at Muldoon’s and the Cloister Café. To Jennifer Ren for being a sounding
board and helping me with French and German. To Father Martin Curtin and William and Mary
Curtin for their spiritual and intellectual support. Thanks to everyone in the family who asked
“how’s it going?” and showered me with prayers and love, especially my aunt Maria, my uncle
Wilfredo, my cousin Michele, my Ramoses and “Uncle Victor.” To my little cousins Michael
and Uriah and baby nephew Jayden for being a constant source of joy. I thank my brother Alan
for allowing me to vent when I needed to and for always having ready words of wisdom or wit to
keep me going, as well as my sister-in-law Tameka for her support. Most of all, I thank my mom,
for ponche de café, for learning about dandies and listening to so many of my think-alouds, for
those quotations that inspired me each day, and for being just about everything for me.
