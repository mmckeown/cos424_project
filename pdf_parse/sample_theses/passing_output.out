ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

“I am a part of all that I have met; yet all experience is an arch wherethrough gleams that
untraveled world, whose margin fades for ever and for ever when I move.”
–Alfred, Lord Tennyson (1809-1892)
Ulysses (1842)

The research of this dissertation would not have been possible without the efforts
of many others. Whether it was through shared resources, scholarly input, teaching
techniques, or involvement in data collection, these contributions were invaluable.
Therefore, I would like to acknowledge several individuals who deserve my utmost
gratitude for their role in my doctoral pursuits.
I would first and foremost like to thank my advisor, Dr. Steven Popoff. From the
first days of medical school when taking Gross Anatomy, it was clear that not only was
he an established scientist, but also a great teacher. I was confident that under his tutelage
I would learn how to be a competent, independent scientist as well as an academician. I
would also like to thank Dr. Mary Barbe who acted as a co-advisor to me; always
available for immediate input and providing direction in the project based on her breadth
of knowledge across many fields. I am also grateful for the efforts of my other
distinguished dissertation committee members, Drs. Victor Rizzo, Dianne Soprano, and
Joan Richtsmeier. Dr. Soprano, along with Tracey Hinton, provided a well-structured and
interactive M.D., Ph.D. program that fostered the success of its students. Dr. Richtsmeier,
as well as Talia Pankratz, were instrumental in our analysis of the craniofacial phenotype
seen in our mouse model. The results of this collaboration were very fruitful and I was
iv

fortunate to have been able to learn so much from an established expert in craniofacial
development. I would also like to thank Dr. Maureen Gannon for providing us our mouse
model and being very engaged in the research of our lab. My thanks to Drs. Nancy
Pleshko and Cushla McGoverin for their resources and time in using the FT-IR analysis. I
am also grateful for the efforts of Ray Meade and others at the University of
Pennsylvania Electron Microscopy Center.
I would also like to acknowledge other graduate students, faculty, and staff in the
Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology. Christina Mundy provided countless hours of
input into the manuscript and was a great lab mate to have. Dr. Robin Pixley and
Roshanak Razmpour were helpful in processing samples for micro-CT and histologic
examination, respectively. And our front office staff of Anita Li, Sydnora Simon, and
John Waterman, was always very helpful in processing vital paperwork.
Lastly, my undying gratitude goes out to my family and close friends, the ones
who lived through the inevitable emotional ups and downs of my graduate education.
They were a source of support whenever it was needed, whether in the form of a bike ride,
a chat, or a drink. Most of all, to my parents and sister, they are the reason for my work
ethic, my pursuit of knowledge, and my desire to push myself to achieve success in any
life endeavor. Fittingly, Tennyson’s Ulysses concludes with this line: “To strive, to seek,
to find, and not to yield.”

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
So many people have been overwhelmingly supportive and understanding of this work that
surely my gratitude cannot be adequately expressed in just words here. Without the guidance,
help, and support of those around me, completing this research would not have been possible. My
hope is that one day, this work will translate to clinical application that serves a patient in need.
First and foremost, I want to thank my advisor, Dr. Ronald F. Tuma. Dr. Tuma’s
expertise and knowledge exist as a benchmark for which I only hope to one day be able to begin
to measure up to. His guidance and input have been tremendously valuable and this research
would not have been possible without him. Further his manner of mentoring and supervision are
also paramount. He provides guidance and leadership but in a way that the student is free to try
new techniques and experiments while ultimately managing his own research. His leadership
has greatly impacted my scientific thinking and developed my skills as a physician scientist.
Almost as important, Dr. Tuma has not only helped develop me as a scientist but also as a
person. He truly is a friend. Ron was there for multiple hardships in my personal life and I
cannot imagine going through them without his guidance or while working for someone else.
I am also immensely grateful to Dr. Doina Ganea. She truly stands as an expert of
immunology and also molecular biology. I want to thank her for her ongoing guidance as well as
entertaining my numerous surprise visits at her door with questions or data to examine. In
addition, I want to express my gratitude to Dr. Sara Jane Ward. Without her immense
knowledge of behavioral studies and morphine tolerance, a lot of this work would not have been
possible. Both of these scientists have been instrumental in my completion of this project and
my development as a scientist.

iv

I owe a multitude of appreciation to the members of my committee. Dr. Rosario Scalia,
Dr. Victor Rizzo, and Dr. Laurie Kilpatrick. I wanted to thank them for their support and input
throughout the years as well as apologize for any emails I may have sent them at 4am to schedule
meetings. I would like to thank the Department of Cellular and Molecular Physiology for being
supportive of my work and helping to impact my graduate education. Lastly, I want to say thank
you to the Center for Substance Abuse Research under the direction of Dr. Ellen Unterwald. Dr.
Unterwald’s center truly carved out a home for us and our work in the Tuma lab. Also, a
tremendously big thank you to Melva Smith and Lynn Heth who have been my savior on far too
many occasions. Also, thank you to Dr. John Gaughan for his assistance with the biostatics of the
Rhodamine studies.
My time in the laboratory has allowed me to meet and work with so many talented
individuals that were always willing to help and teach. In Dr. Ganea’s laboratory I want to thank
Virginia Koceida, Sabina Adhikary, Fran Emig, Dr. Mario Skarica, Dr. Weimin Kong, and Dr.
Jimmy Yen. Thank you guys for being so open to answering questions and teaching me. In my
own laboratory I want to thank Dr. Ming Zhang, Dr. Hongbo Li, and Richard Ronca. Again, your
guidance and help have been not only tremendously helpful but also inspiring. Hongbo in
particular, this could not have been completed without you and I will be forever grateful for your
assistance on so many occasions.
None of this would have been possible without an outside support system. I think it is
appropriate to thank all the people that have put up with my tardiness, cancelled plans, complaints,
and for just being there throughout the years. A huge thanks to Matthew Santiago, not only for
being a great friend but for being an amazing Chief of Operations and keeping Temple University
Emergency Medical Services running in my absence. Thank you for covering my shifts all the
v

nights I was late. Thank you to Rebecca Vallas for talking me through so many problems and
providing some perspective. To this day, we may be the only people to have discussed cannabinoid
receptor knockout mice at the Dunkin Donuts at Broad and Alleghany. And lastly, thank you to
Nathan Carr-Whealy. I don’t know where to begin other than to say you have been the voice of
reason and thank you for so many late night dinner runs to rejuvenate. You always do that.
And most importantly, I want to thank my family. For without them and their love and
support, I would have never completed this project. Thank you to my aunt Darlene for always
making me laugh. Thank you to my brother, Kenneth for always listening to my problems and
talking me through them. Your expertise in clinical stroke treatment has also been hugely helpful
and inspiring to me. I want to thank you and your wife, Erin, for bringing the kids, Tyler and
Makenna, to visit me on so many weekends in lab. Some of my favorite memories of lab will be
your kids feeding my mice Fruit Loops and examining the big pickles hanging in the lobby of the
medical school. Lastly, but certainly not least, thank you Mom and Dad. I do not know what I
would have done without you guys. Thank you both for always being so understanding and
supportive. Thank you for all my late night phone calls and for always making me feel better when
lab didn’t treat me the way I hoped it would. The dedication I watched you two put forth on so
many projects growing up really inspired me to see this project through. And so many times
throughout my life you looked at me and said, “Can do.” I kept that in mind. Thank you.

I would like to thank the faculty members who have helped me with this project. Dr.
Randy Wyatt provided much guidance, as well as appropriate literature and ideas. I would
like to thank Dr. Samuel Gerson for encouraging me to expand my analysis, and Dr. Valory
Mitchell for her sharp editing skills. Without her, I doubt I would have proposed.
I would like to thank all of my friends and colleagues who pushed me to think more
clearly upon the subject matter and encouraged my passion for the topic.
Finally, I would like to thank my family. I thank my parents for believing in me and
supporting me. My wife, Erin Harrell, was unwavering in her confidence in me. I cannot
imagine a life without her seeing me through. I would also like to thank my daughter, Ara
Jean, who sacrificed countless quality hours with me, and gave up ever being read three
important books of Dr. Seuss’s by her mother.

encouragement and my sisters’ undying belief in my ability, I would not have journeyed
into the world of graduate school.
Thank you to my friends and colleagues who provided endless support. I would
especially like to acknowledge Christine DiRubbo, who spent many sleepless nights with
me, studying in coffee shops and on patios. Thank you for the motivation,
encouragement, and friendship.
Most importantly, I wish to express my deepest gratitude to my biggest supporter,
my husband Nicholas Greenfield. Thank you for moving across the country in support of
my aspirations, for carrying me through the worst of the last four years, and for
celebrating with me when milestones—however small—were met. Your work ethic is
inspirational and your belief in me is uplifting.

I would like to thank my family and friends for their support during these
past few years of research. I want to especially thank my husband Casey for
giving me endless support and enduring all of the strains of graduate school first
hand. I want to thank my mother Lise for interesting me in science at young age
and for sharing all her wisdom about scientific research and the trials of
completing a PhD. I also want to thank my father Stan and brother Nate for their
continued support.
I could not have completed any of this work without the excellent
mentorship of Dr. Steven Houser, the best boss anyone could hope to work for.
Dr. Houser and all members of his laboratory were invaluable towards
completing this research. My fellow graduate student, Catherine Makarewich,
provided friendly support as well as help with molecular biology and myocyte
physiology experiments. Dr. Hajime Kubo provided scientific expertise and input
across all aspects of this project, and none of this project could have been
accomplished without help from him or from our lab manager, Mr. Remus
Berretta. Also, I want to give a special thanks to Thomas Sharp for help with
stem cell isolation and culture, and to Timothy Starosta, Yumi Chiba, and
Sharmeen Husain for all their help with histology.
This project would have been impossible without the help of our invaluable
collaborator, Dr. Piero Anversa, a world expert in the field of cardiac repair who
shocked the field years ago with his “wild” idea that the heart actually had the
iv

capacity to regenerate. After 15 years, my work and the work of many others
has continued to validate what he has been saying all along. Thank you to the
members of his team at Brigham and Women’s hospital including Dr. Marcello
Rota, who taught me all the techniques involved in a mouse model of myocardial
infarction and stem cell transplant, Dr. Annarosa Leri for continued assistance
with stem cell characterization, Dr. Toru Hosoda for help with stem cell isolation,
and Dr. Jan Kajstura (who is, in my opinion, the best histologist in the world).
I would also like to thank my collaborators at Temple, Dr. Madesh
Muniswamy and his student Nicholas Hoffman, Dr. Mike Autieri, his student Ross
England and his lab manager Sheri Kelemen, and the members of Fox Chase
Cancer Center’s Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Core; Dr. Eric Ross and Dr.
Fang Zhu, who helped me develop statistical models for all of my experiments. I
would like to thank Liz Opalka and Lewis Holt-Bright, members of Temple’s
University Lab Animal Research Facility who helped care for my research
animals during the course of my experiments. I also must thank my committee
members for their continued help and guidance: Dr. Emily Tsai and Dr. Rosario
Scalia in addition to Drs. Rota and Autieri who have already been mentioned.
Finally I must thank Dr. Dianne Soprano and Tracey Hinton who run Temple’s
MD/PhD program. Dr. Soprano gave me an incredible opportunity to join the
program here at Temple, and I will be forever thankful to her for allowing me to
fulfill my dream of becoming a physician scientist.
