Most importantly, I would like to thank my mentor, Suzanne Mazzeo, for her thoughtful
support and feedback throughout this project. Without your encouragement and sponsorship, I
could not have pursued this project. I admire and aspire to your level of insight and your analytic
approach to problems. I feel lucky to have worked with you, and could not have asked for a
better mentor.
This dissertation research was supported in part by a grant from the American
Psychological Association. APA had no role in the study design, collection, analysis or
interpretation of the data, or writing the manuscript. The project also received funding for
equipment from the Higher Education Equipment Trust Fund of Virginia, which purchased some
of the eye tracking equipment. Consultation for these and other grant proposals made this
funding possible. I would like to thank Dr. Paul Wetzel, Dr. Nancy Zucker, Dr. Leroy Thacker,
as well as my committee members, Dr. Eric Benotsch, Dr. Sandra Gramling, and Dr. Natalie
Shook, for their guidance and feedback in shaping this project and in my professional
development. Additionally, professionals at Applied Science Laboratories were crucial in the
transition to the new eye tracking equipment, and in my training in this area. I would like to
thank Bill Vaughn in particular for the many hours of support and training he provided.
Finally, I would like to thank my family and friends for their support. Their patience and
interest when I could not talk about anything else, their encouragement throughout the entire
process, and their willingness to help in any and every way have reminded me again and again
how truly special they are.

This dissertation is a product of an enormous amount of hours of discussion with
my mentor and advisor, Dr. Michael Alexander. His kind and thoughtful, simple and firm
approach to mentorship pulled me from a resigned state and empowered me to do my
part. Through his efforts, I have grown as a researcher, a scholar-practitioner, and as
person. I acknowledge and appreciate the tremendous assistance and support, wrapped in
patience, which I received from my committee: Dr. Cathy Royal and Dr. Levy. A special
thank you to Dr. Daphne DePorres for always being just in time to set the pace. I am
deeply thankful to Dr. Shawn Richmond for assisting me in restructuring and
repositioning my passion in the process. I also appreciate the help of my microfinance
guru, Dr. Yoshano Gheneti, for his great insights in the process.
I am grateful to my husband, Moses Bamuwamye, whose brilliance with patience
in chaos challenged my judgment to balance. I could not have come this far without his
support. My junior champions, Ruth and Abigail, and the departed Daudi for being great
cheerleaders in the years of chaos over the course of my doctoral journey.
I am deeply indebted to the girls in my league: my own sister Mrs. Alexandria
Mwogeza, for getting me off the seat of excuses; my senior cheerleader, Druscilla
Senkungu; and my power-girl niece Phoebe Kyamwine, without whom I would not have
come this far. A special thank you to my cousin, friend, and research counsel, Dr. Lydia
Kapiriri for keeping me grounded in theory and the collected data. To my family and
friends: thank you for believing in me. My dissertation would not be complete without
the support of my cohort members who empowered me to look ahead and keep moving.
Last, but not least, I would like to acknowledge and appreciate the firm and loving
support and guidance of my God, the All-Knowing, who has been my guide and anchor
through it all.

First, to my friends and family, I am blessed to have you in my life. You all are
such an important part of my journey. Without your support, nurturing, and kindness, I
couldn’t achieve this or any dream. You helped in so many ways, and I forever will be
grateful.
From the first day I entered Dr. Toni Greif’s course room several years ago, I
knew she would impact my educational journey and career. Her practical, empathetic,
strategic, and probing approach resonated with me from the moment I read her bio. I
knew I would learn from someone who has her depth of experience and breadth of
knowledge but remains focused on the important things in life: baseball and sunny
weather. Dr. Toni’s enthusiasm, mentoring, energy, and realism have motivated me to not
let myself rest in the obvious. Through her encouragement, I am driven to learn more and
push myself beyond what is expected of me by most people. Dr. Toni has taught me
lessons that extend far beyond the classroom and dissertation process. I will not forget
her approach to teaching and leading – it has changed my outlook on life.
Thank you to my committee members, Dr. Robin Parry and Dr. Cyd Strickland,
for your patience, encouragement, and enthusiasm for each phase in the dissertation
process. Your energy, commitment to high standards, and direction were very valuable
and will always be appreciated.
Thank you to my tremendous colleagues, bosses, peers, and team members. You
have lifted me up throughout this journey and helped me stay focused on my goal. The
support is meaningful.

This thesis exists because of the vision and guidance of my advisor, Professor Tom Heaton. I truly
appreciate the way he advises me, providing me the freedom to find a challenging problem and the
solution to it, as well as his ready advice and support based on his broad knowledge in earthquake
engineering and seismology.
I would like to thank Swami Krishnan and Anna Olsen for providing me the building designs and
models, as well as helping me interpret the results
Shijia (Wendy) Chen, Vanessa Heckman, and Grant Hollis reviewed early drafts of this thesis, and I
appreciate their great feedback.
My fellow graduate students in the Civil Engineering Department, Michael Cheng, Ramses
Mourhatch, Hemanth Siriki, and Stephen Wu. Life would be different without you guys.
This thesis also would not exist but for the love and support of my parents. They sent me to United
States for my higher education, and I hope this thesis shows that that was the right decision.

I would like to thank my advisors, Professor Todd Gitlin, who beyond scholarly
insight kept my work grounded in contemporary culture and current affairs of the U.S.
and Israel; Professor Brigitte Nacos, who was the first to appreciate and support my
quest to understand the relationship between news media and terrorism victims;
Professor Michael Schudson, who among many other things helped me build the
foundations for this work by guiding me through my literature review, and finally, my
very special thanks go to Professor Andie Tucher, who as an advisor and a friend
shepherded me through this five year journey. Prof. Tucher’s relentless belief in me
gave me the confidence that despite all of life’s turbulences, I would eventually reach
the finish line.
I would like to thank my family and friends, who stood by me throughout all of the
big life changes that took place during these years. My parents and in-laws, who
provided me a constant web of support and child care when I was writing the
dissertation, having a full time job and raising three kids. This would have been
impossible without their love, dedication and at times, forgiveness for my absence.
My deepest thanks go to my husband Dan and to our children. Although young in age,
Amnon, Alona and Eric showed maturity by understanding that mommy’s quest
required hard work and time alone. I am thankful to them and hopeful that gratitude
will never turn to guilt over that lost bonding time. Dan supported me every step of
the way, with amazing insights, and occasionally, with entire Saturdays spent as a
single dad. Dan, my heart goes out to you in love and gratitude.

There are so many people I need to thank for either helping, or encouraging me through
this process. If I forget any of you here, please forgive me – I’m exhausted! Please know that I
am so very grateful for everyone who has helped in any way.

To my advisor, Dr. Monica Tracey who has always been there pushing (sometimes prodding)
me along. When I met you so long ago, I never dreamed we’d end up here, but I couldn’t
have asked for a better advisor. Knowing that I have you in my corner has made this process
much easier. I consider you a friend, colleague, and mentor and hope we can continue to
work together. Your energy and enthusiasm inspires me. I have so much to learn from you.

To Dr. Marcus Dickson, who is technically my outside committee member, but will always
be my mentor and advisor, a huge thank you. You have always stood by me and supported
me, even after my decision to leave Psychology and pursue a degree in Instructional
Technology. I will never forget the horror on your face when I was accosted by a homeless
person when you were giving me a tour of Wayne State University so many years ago. I’m
sure you thought the girl from Iowa would never return, but I did and you’ve been there
every step of the way. I never planned to be a teacher when I started graduate school, but
watching and learning from you is a big part of why I ultimately decided to make teaching
my life’s work.

To the rest of my committee, Dr. Timothy Spannaus and Dr. Ingrid Guerra-Lopez, thank you
so much for feedback and support throughout. And also thank you to the rest of the faculty,
staff, and my colleagues in the IT department. Dr. James Moseley and Michele Norris, for
your assistance in navigating this process. Dr. Nandita Mani, a friend and colleague, for the
emotional support and cheerleading. It’s been a great pleasure working with all of you.

A special thank you to Dr. Rita Richey. Many years ago, I sat in your office uncertain as to
whether I should make the very difficult decision to switch graduate programs and start all
over again with Instructional Technology. Your no-nonsense advice was just what I needed
to hear. Several years (and a lot of work) later, I don’t regret the decision, and am so very
grateful to you.

Of course I must thank all the experts who participated in my study. It was a huge time
commitment at a horrible time of the year for educational developers. Getting to meet and
interact with all of you – the best and brightest in my field – throughout the course of this
dissertation has been amazing.

A special round of thanks goes to my dear friend, Dr. Nardina Mein. You have provided me
with so many opportunities and such great advice, I truly cannot explain how grateful I am to
you. You saw potential in me so long ago and nurtured that in a way nobody ever had. I’ve
grown very fond of our regular coffee dates and deeply value your friendship.

I also give thanks to my many faculty colleagues, whom I now consider friends, from Wayne
State University. Working with all of you continually affirmed my decision to pursue a
career in educational development. Thank you for believing in and encouraging me.

To my new colleagues at Wake Forest University, especially Dr. Catherine Ross, thank you
for welcoming me with open arms. It’s been refreshing to work with and learn from an
experienced educational developer. I look forward to learning more!

Of course there are many others, who have nothing to do with this degree, but have been
constant sources of support. Laurie Miller, for always believing in me and Dawn Dayton, for
keeping me sane (though others around us might disagree) and laughing. I love you both.

And finally, to my husband, Drew. There are no words except I love you.

I would like to express the deepest appreciation to my committee chair and
academic advisor, Professor Satya N. Atluri, for his outstanding professional advices, great
care and encouragement, and financial support. Without his guidance and persistent help
this dissertation would not have been possible.
I gratefully thank my colleague, Professor Leiting Dong, Hohai University, China, for
the fruitful collaboration we made together and the excellent ideas he provided. I also
thank Professor Jan Sladek, Slovak Academy of Science, Slovakia, for his help in part of my
study.
I would like to thank my committee members, Professor Lorenzo Valdevit and
Professor Timothy J. Rupert for their review of this study and for the time they spent with
me in useful technical and professional discussions.
Finally, I thank my wife for her patience, care and understanding throughout my
study, and our parents for their great love and encouragement.

I would like to thank the many individuals who have contributed invaluably to my
doctoral education.
Dr. Theodore I. Lidsky became a true inspiration to me during my
undergraduate education and more importantly became a genuine friend. He introduced me into
the world of lead toxicology, behavioral neuroscience and electrophysiology. I valued his ability
to see past my educational marks and his nurturing of my critical thinking. He will forever be a
dear friend of mine. I thank both Dr. Probal Banerjee and Dr. Ekkehart Trenkner for the many
discussions on my early education and encouraging me to continue towards a Masters’ degree
and pursue a doctorate. I would like to also acknowledge Dr. Joshua Wallman's contribution to
my education with his enthusiastic teachings of cellular biophysics. I never found
electrophysiology more interesting until I experienced his lectures and translation of the content.
Dr. Joshua Wallman unfortunately passed away ~ two years ago. He will be dearly missed. I
would like to acknowledge Dr. Edward Meehan, for his discussions and feedback regarding
behavioral psychology and the principles of learning and behavior with respect to the methods I
employed in my dissertation. I am grateful for Dr. Robert Freedland's many discussions on the
statistics employed in my dissertation and the ongoing financial support through the Center for
Developmental Neuroscience and The New York State Institute for Basic Research. I would like
to formally thank and acknowledge The CUNY Graduate Center for their most generous Science
Fellowship that offset the financial cost of my degree over the last five years, whilst providing
me an invaluable opportunity in teaching undergraduate education at the professoriate level. This
experience has offered me an invaluable insight into academia and research which I will pursue
as a career beyond my doctorate.
Dr. Gail Smith contributed invaluably to my education by supporting minority students
through The Alliances for Graduate Education and the Professoriate (AGEP) CUNY initiative.
If it weren’t for Dr. Gail Smith's efforts in maintaining such a resourceful program I would not
have secured two NSF summer research Grants supporting my dissertation work. Mrs. Evans
Green I am especially grateful to for her support over the many years. I was an entry level
minority student at The College of Staten Island’s Science and Technology Entry Program
(STEP) in the 6th grade where I first met her. Years later, I was reunited with her through The
College of Staten Island’s Collegiate Science and Technology Entry Program (C-STEP).
Through STEP and C-STEP I was fortunate to become part of a wonderful networking
opportunity and another form of financial assistance in supporting my doctoral research as a
minority student. I would like to thank Dr. Claude Brathwaite for his ongoing support,
encouragement, and being hard on me throughout the years to complete my Ph.D. If it weren’t
for him and The Louis Strokes Alliance for Minority Participation (LSAMP) program I would
not have been exposed to the many prospective career networks that I currently have today. In
addition, the LSAMP funding contributed significantly to my dissertation work and permitted me
access to many forums to present my research both local and abroad. I have continued to have a
remarkable relationship with him over the years throughout my Ph.D.
As for my committee members, Dr. Andrzej Wieraszko became a very close mentor to
me over the years. He encouraged me to strive more and approach questions from many angles
in science. His impartial character and his focus on developing my methodological approaches
in synaptosomal and hippocampal slice physiology were invaluable. Dr. William J. L’Amoreaux
was a very influential person in my early career.
He never stopped criticizing my work,
thinking, research designs, and especially my writing. He always made me strive longer and
harder than any other doctoral student in approaching my dissertation. He truly taught me to fail,
accept the situation, and problem solve in order to experience success. His discussions and
feedback with regard to my immunological experimentation and microscopy has resulted in this
body of work. I would like to thank both Dr. Jay S. Schneider and Dr. Theodore I. Lidsky for
their inspiration to work in the field of lead toxicology and their invaluable commentary and
expertise with aligning my dissertation and its relationships to clinical correlates of human lead
toxicity. They both have afforded me tremendous opportunities that I am forever grateful. I
would like to thank Dr. George C. Wagner for his invaluable insight into neurotoxicology and
his suggestions to the many methods I employed in the behavioral pharmacology aspect of my
dissertation. His commentaries on my behavioral neuropharmacological methods were critical in
developing my thinking and research designs during my dissertation. I would like to thank Dr.
Chang-Hui Shen for his willingness and invaluable opportunity to teach me qRT-PCR and the
intricate concepts behind such a powerful technique in molecular biological science. I am very
grateful to his open door policy within his lab and cherish the relationship we built over such a
short time.
I cannot forget the many doctoral students that became close friends over the years: Dr.
Jonathan Blaize, Dr. Janto Tachjadi, Dr. Sarah Guariglia, Dr. Susan Briffa-Mirabella, Dr. Ahmed
Abouelela , Dr. Amit Mogha, Dr. Kelly Levano, Dr. Christopher Corbo, Dr. Latifa Boukarrou,
Dr. Salim Bendaoud, Alex Marsillo, Daniel Kerr, Brian Iskra, Simon Ng, Nicholas Volpe,
Evelyn Okeke, Navita Madan, Alyssa Ferraro, and my dearest of friends Francoise Sidime and
Dr. Xin Yan. I am especially grateful for the assistance, support, and aid of the animal vivarium
staff: Joanne, Ana, Alyssa, David, Matt, Lisa, Pia, and Sarah for taking excellent care of my
animals during my dissertation. I am very grateful for Ms. Angela Cartmel for her IACUC
oversights of my project. A very special acknowledgement is due to Mrs. Diane Cocozza, who
dedicated 35 years of her life to foster graduate student success throughout The Center for
Developmental Neuroscience and The NYS Institute for Basic Research. Mrs. Cocozza worked
tirelessly to ensure we students were taken care of through the many financial and clerical
matters governing our degrees. I wish her and her husband a very pleasant and well deserved
retirement.
Lastly, I am eternally grateful to my mentor and dear friend Dr. Abdeslem El Idrissi. As
I look back and reflect over the years I would not be able to imagine myself where I am today if
it were not for his genuine investment in my education and me. I am especially honored that he
was so understanding of my families’ situations with my father’s passing and my mother’s
hardships following this unfortunate circumstance. In many ways, he may not have realized it,
but I looked up to him in many paternal ways throughout my master’s and doctoral education.
Having come from a family of minimally educated relatives, it is very hard to find a genuine role
model who will invest into you their lifelong love and passion of their career in science. I have
never met a more inspirational man who would give nearly everything of himself for the
betterment of others. He has not only inspired me, but further has been an immovable
cornerstone to my education. His tireless commitment to push me to be better, wiser, concise,
more technical, and especially independent has developed not only my academic character, but
the young scientist that I am today.
I cannot thank Dr. Abdeslem El Idrissi enough for
everything he has done to aid me, keep me at times in check, and notably tolerate me as his
graduate student over the years. I have truly learned an invaluable amount of science and life
lessons from him, but also regarding collegial relationships and of myself through this doctoral
experience. He will remain as a close friend for the many years to come and a future research
collaborator.
A final thank you is rightfully deserved for the many animals whose sacrifices resulted in
this body of work that has contributed to the ongoing understanding of lead toxicity on
neurodevelopment and GABAergic disruptions. I hope that their contributions results in a new
area of focus within the field of lead toxicity with hopes of finding translational approaches to
treat and/or ameliorate this environmentally induced neurodevelopmental disorder.

When I first received the call from Dr. Linda Purrington to tell me that I was accepted in
to the Educational Leadership, Administration, and Policy program at Pepperdine University, I
was honored beyond belief. Little did I know that this same person would walk me step-by-step
through the dissertation process. Dr. Purrington, you have such a way with words, you could
encourage anyone to believe that they could accomplish the most difficult task. There were times
I thought I might not make it through, times when you expressed more confidence in me than I
had in myself. Thank you for your guidance, patience, and persistence in getting me through the
final stage of this program.
To Dr. Barner, thank you for giving me words of encouragement and challenging me to
have an uncompromising sense of integrity as an administrator. Your example is characterized
by a father’s love for his own children. You made me feel like you considered me as one of your
own children. I will forever be grateful for the interest you took in providing me with guidance
and wisdom. Because of you, I believe that there is a greater purpose for me. When it comes to
fruition, I will definitely be ready.
To Dr. Doug Leigh and Dr. Anthony Collatos, thank you for not accepting marginal
work. Your approaches to teaching challenged me to produce work that was worthy of a
doctorate. I appreciate your commitment to maintaining the integrity and quality of academia by
refusing to compromise your expectations. I truly admire your candid demeanor.
To Dr. Linda Jungwirth, thank you for your encouraging words and optimism. Your
approach to teaching inspires students to believe that all things are possible to those who are
willing to dream. Continue instilling hope and confidence in people.
To Dr. Hoffman, thank you for taking the time to participate on my dissertation
committee and allowing me to conduct my research at the study site. You encouraged me to take
on the challenge of earning my doctorate not knowing that this was a lifelong goal I already had.
Your commitment to developing educational leaders has helped me to grow tremendously as an
administrator. You saw potential in me and had the insight to give me a chance at being an
administrator at a young age. I will forever be grateful that you not only gave me a chance, but
also invested in my growth as an educational leader. Thank you.
To Dr. St. Gean, thank you for your encouragement and guidance. I have learned so
much about being an administrator through your mentorship. You have provided wisdom and
experience that has helped me to grow tremendously as an administrator.
To my co-workers and everyone who has ever provided emotional support to complete
this work. Thank you so much.
And last, but definitely not least, thank you C7! You are my second family. It was such a
privilege to meet each and every one of you. The time in the classroom went by too fast. It is too
bad that we do not have to spend any more weekends together. You are all so talented and
brilliant. We should put all of our resources together and form a super school. I wish you all the
best.
