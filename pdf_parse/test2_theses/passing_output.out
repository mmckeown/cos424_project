I would first like to thank my advisor, Sarah Tolbert, without whom I
wouldn’t be here today. She always supported me in my most ambitious research
schemes, and I am grateful for the opportunity she gave me to dream big.
I would like to acknowledge my committee members, Professors Richard
Kaner and Bruce Dunn, for their support, especially in the final stretch, and
Professor Paul Weiss for serving on my qualifying committee.
Thank you to my collaborators, especially those who helped in the design and
construction of the plasma instrument in Chapter 2. I received invaluable advice on
plasmas and RF electronics from Professor Francis Chen, Dr. Nathan Marchack, Dr.
Joseph Nemanick, and most especially Dr. Winston Ciridon at the University of
Washington in Seattle, who hosted me for a tour of his plasma instruments in the
lab of Professor Buddy Ratner, and lent me the matching network I used for all of
my depositions. Under the direction of Professor Bruce Dunn, Dr. Daniel Membrano
worked with me on all the impedance data collection in Chapter 3.
Dr. Laura
Schelhas spent many weekends and early mornings gathering XPS for each film
studied for impedance in chapter 3, as well as for countless more coatings analyzed
in the optimization of the plasma instrument and in the following optimization of the
PEO-like films.
I would like to thank Dr. Benjamin Hahn for being my mentor and
collaborator on a variety of iron oxide projects, including the work in Chapter 4,
while I was on internship at the Naval Research Labs. He went above and beyond
even to the extent of sharing his bench top, which my samples at times
overwhelmed. Often times. Sorry Ben! I am eternally grateful to my internship
advisor Dr. Debra Rolison, for welcoming me into her lab group.
I thoroughly
enjoyed my summer in your lab group, the opportunity to have you as a mentor,
and the many conversations I had with you and all your group members both in lab
and over coffee breaks or lunches.
I am and will always be grateful to Dr. Carolyn Knobler for always believing
in me.
Without her mentorship and words of wisdom, the struggle may have
overwhelmed me. Thank you for all your time and kind words. You were the key
reason I regained hope and re-committed to this degree on at least 2 occasions.
The last time we spoke, you saw a strength and passion in me that I did not think I
possessed anymore. Thank you for giving that strength back to me.
I have had the incredible good fortune to be joined in the doctoral trenches
with some of the most amazing minds, and the best friends I could ever ask for.
Dr. Christina Baker, my Apple Pan recruiter, whose office was my second oncampus home during my first year, and whose house has been my second home
throughout graduate school.
My first office-roommate and fellow salty oatmeal
aficionado, Selma, for all the front lawn lunch breaks and pep talks that got me
through the first two years. Beware: some birthday you’ll come home again to find
Iris and me in your living room.
Thanks to Dr. Rachel Harper, my good friend,
critic, therapist, neighbor, and Erin-wrangler. I can still hear you some nights at 4
AM, saying, “So, imagine an L, with one side shorter than the other. . .” No matter
what you were going through, or how many days you’d gone without sleep, you
always had time to keep the rest of us from imploding. To Dr. Iris Rauda, my dear
friend and chair space competitor with whom I shared an office for 4 years that did
not actually have room for the both of us.
We became close in only a way that
people who sit an inch apart can be. We made it through the tough middle years of
grad school together and saw each other through the final stage. I don’t know how
I would have made it to the end without you.
I am so appreciative, lucky, and thankful to have Thom by my side, who
intuitively knows exactly what I need to feel grounded. You view every one of my
challenges as a team effort, and kept finding ways to take more and more off my
shoulders as the thesis piled more and more on.
I also have to thank you for
seeing the person behind the insanity while I’ve been finishing. I love you. And
thank you to the Buckwalters, who lent me their living room to haunt all hours of
day and night while writing this thesis.
Lastly, I would like to thank my parents and siblings, who have always
supported me in all of my endeavors. My father, who taught me the importance of
a good handshake, and who gave me my first early lessons in electronics and
hardware. My mother who always thought we could do anything, especiallyy after
someone else told us that we couldn’t. And whose question of “Are you done yet?”
I can finally answer.

There are a countless number of people I can credit who have influenced my
professional and personal life over the years. First, I want to thank my mom and dad for
nurturing my curiosity and love of science and agriculture since I was a child. I also thank
my brother Jim and my best friend Joe Pavich; you guys have been there for me since we
were kids, and I can’t think of any better partners in crime.
At Purdue, it should go without saying that sincere thanks goes to Dr. Herb Ohm.
You fostered my interest in plant breeding, which would lay the foundation for making many
other great professional relationships.
Here in North Carolina, greatest thanks go to my advisor, Dr. Jim Holland. Your
knowledge and patience over the last five years made graduate school into a far less painful
experience than what I had anticipated. Thanks also go to my other doctoral committee
members, Drs. Gary Payne, Peter Balint-Kurti, and Ross Whetten. Many, many members of
the Holland Lab have contributed help or insight to this dissertation over the last two and a
half years, including, but not limited to: Drs. Shilpa Sood, Funda Ogut, Bode Olukolu, and
Jason Cook; technicians Jason Brewer and Josie Bloom; temporary employees Steve
Pigozzo, Brittany Scott, Colt Jackson, Carlos Vega, and Sarah Davidson-Dyer; and graduate
students David Horne, Kristen Kump, Yang Bian, and Shang Xue. Visiting doctoral student
Fernando Samayoa from the CSIC (Spain) made possible a great collaboration in this
dissertation.
I also want to thank the many fellow graduate students both past and present that have
been great friends to me while here at NCSU. Among them: Jill Recker, Oliver Ott, Dave
Eickholt, Stine Petersen, Justin Ma, Emma Flemmig, and Dr. Jose Santa Cruz. Above all
else, I want to single out Dr. Jake Delheimer. Hanging out with you on the weekends made
the rest of the week bearable.
Last, but greatest of all, I want to thank my beautiful, intelligent, and sometimes
unbearably witty/sarcastic wife Katie. Your support for the last ten years is beyond words,
and I can’t wait to start the next chapter of our life together.

Graduate school is a marathon, well maybe more of a sprint marathon.
Throughout this race I have received constant support from a variety of sources that have
ultimately helped me to complete this race, and I would like to take this moment to thank
everyone who helped me along the way. First of all, I would like to thank my committee
for unparalleled academic support. My advisor, Professor Jackie Barton, has provided a
great lab environment to work in, given me many challenges that have helped me grow as
a scientist, and supported me in my many endeavors. She has taught me the importance
of obtaining a good work-life balance. My committee chair, Professor Harry Gray, has
always provided great discussion and was always willing to lend an ear. Professor Sarah
Reisman has always been a source of enthusiasm, encouragement, and provided an
important outside perspective to my scientific problems throughout graduate school.
Finally, I would like to thank Professor Judy Campbell for not only engaging in
extremely helpful discussions about yeast and yeast proteins, but also for opening up her
lab to help us with our projects. I’d also like to thank our collaborators Professor John
Tainer and Justin Ishida, and, in particular, Dr. Jill Fuss, whose expertise in not only
protein biology, but also DNA repair has been invaluable to me. I would like to thank
her for always being available to discuss problems and providing a constant supply of
protein. I’d also like to thank my undergraduate advisor Scott Silverman as well as Dana
Baum for their constant encouragement and initial research training.
During a race, I would find it impossible to make it through without aid. I’d like
to thank the many members of the support staff here at Caltech, who go above and
beyond their jobs to make graduate school much easier. Throughout my time here,
Agnes Tong has been a constant source of humor and encouragement. Her love of
Disney and travel is enthusiastic, and I will miss dropping by her office to catch up and
have a quick cup of coffee. Steve, Leah, and Elisa have made sure that I always have
what I need. Joe, Ron, and Memo have been invaluable when the bunker is a mess,
letting me drive the cart, and always being friendly. Silva is amazing for her vast
computer knowledge and is always upbeat and cheerful. I’d like to finally thank
Maureen Renta for always having a good pot of coffee, a good story, and always being
supportive for whatever problems I had. She has been another constant source of support
throughout this race, and I can’t thank her enough for everything that she has done.
Before even deciding to run a race you need inspiration. My family has provided
endless support and has pushed me to always do my best. From an early age my
grandparents have always encouraged me to pursue the sciences. My parents, Roth and
Jenny, have always helped me pursue my interests even if they were a little out there.
They have always stood by my side and provided unconditional love and support. My
brother, Michael, is a constant source of inspiration as he pursues what he is passionate
about and constantly challenges me to be better. My Aunt Ruth and Uncle Bob have had
to mediate endless battles between my brother and myself, so it is thanks to them that I
survived long enough to get to grad school. I’d also like to thank my Aunt Kathy and
Uncle John for always encouraging me to do after-school activities and providing the
three most wonderful cousins in the world, and also my Uncle George and Aunt Jan for
always making sure that I’m in tip-top dental shape! I’d also like to thank my aunts and
uncles on my mother’s side who have always encouraged me to do well in school.
Together, my family has been there for me to not only get me into the race, but also to
watch me finish it.
In the early part of a race, it is important to not burn out. I’d like to thank my
fellow brothers in Alpha Chi Sigma for their continued support. In particular, those who
always got to play the bonus or just wanted to drive down to Matt’s: Valerie, Jeanne,
Nick, James, Colin, Status, Nick, Kevin, and Kurt. In particular, I’d like to thank my
running buddies Joe and Matt for being willing to travel to random places to run a race
and maybe stay at a hotel that’s a little far from the start line. I’d also like to thank Jason
and Julia for their constant support. Ever since undergrad, we’ve gone on so many
adventures and they have always been there for me. My good friend Jason has always
been up for a productive conversation ranging from spreads, to straddles, to favorites, to
where the euro is going, those topics always kept life interesting over those Fuji lunches.
Finally, I thank John and April for always making sure we see each other during winter
breaks even though they root for Michigan now. These friends have always kept me
going and I’ve always enjoyed all the great memories that we have shared.
The middle of the race can be boring and it’s important to be able to get through
this rough patch. I’ve had the opportunity to work with some of the most amazing people
over the years. I’d like to thank Barton group members past and present for always
having wonderful discussions and being part of one of the most interesting D-league
softball teams out there. I’d especially like to acknowledge the North Side both past and
present for putting up with all of my lousy music choices. Also I’d like to thank the
lunch crew for always being there; Anna for always being there to talk about mini things
and travel plans, and Katie for always being there when I needed to talk. Finally, to
Alyson, Alex, and Phil for many tasty dinners, Broad breakfasts and terrible movies.
The last few miles can be the most miserable without proper training and help.
These folks helped me throughout the race, but in particular helped me with that last
mile. I’d like to thank Alexis and Andrew for being rational and always being willing to
lend an ear and for always bringing back coffee! I’d also like to thank my friend
Elizabeth for always being a phone call away to help me get through those rough times.
DJ Pam has always been a source of humor, encouragement, and a great joke! I’ll always
remember our crazy adventures and wonderful memories. This goes without saying, but
Kaycie has been the most incredible friend ever, and I’d like to thank for her always
listening to my crazy issues over Go China and for preventing me from making the
biggest mistake of my life. Finally, I’d like to thank my favorite co-worker, Ariel,
without whom I don’t think I could’ve made it through the last kick; she bakes the best
pumpkin pies and always makes me smile.

I expected a rich scientific experience at Caltech, but never imagined how
personally fulfilling my time here would be. For that I have a great number of people to
thank. First and foremost, I want to extend heartfelt thanks to my graduate advisor
Dennis Dougherty. I appreciate the extensive freedom he gives his students and yet the
compassion and personal dedication he devotes to each one of us. Dennis is a supremely
talented communicator, and I especially value the lessons I've learned about speaking,
writing, and teaching from him. I also appreciate the support he has given me and the
confidence he has instilled in me to tackle hard scientific problems and to explore a new
field after Caltech.
Henry Lester, a longtime collaborator of the Dougherty group, is an inexhaustible
source of suggestions for new experiments and novel approaches to scientific problems. I
value his scientific rigor and his dedication to his students. I also want to thank the
members of my thesis committee, Peter Dervan, Doug Rees, and David Tirrell for their
support and suggestions, both with regards to my graduate research and my career.
The Dougherty group has been a fantastic place to work (and a fantastic place at
times to hang out and not work too). I really look forward to keeping in touch with
everyone I overlapped with in the group. When I first arrived in lab, Ariele Hanek, Kiowa
Bower, and Kristin Gleitsman had saintly patience while I was learning the ropes, passed
on endless sage advice, and made me feel welcome. I’m very glad I got to know Jai
Shanata, who always brought a valuable quantitative rigor to scientific discussions and
whose worldview is refreshingly optimistic. Sean Kedrowski answered so, so, many of
my chemistry questions and put up with all assortment of canned fish and other exciting
	  
v	  
lunch items that I brought in. I really enjoyed sitting next to him for three years. Angela
Blum and Nyssa Puskar, with whom I overlapped for a good deal of grad school, have
great integrity and are supremely capable researchers. Kay Limapichat helped me
immensely to get started on fluorescence experiments and was generous with time and
with materials she worked long to prepare. Noah Duffy is a hell of a human being. He
always has an open mind, really thinks things through, and can fix absolutely anything.
Kristina Daeffler, Ximena da Silva, Maggie Thompson, and I all entered Caltech
together and had the wisdom to join the Dougherty group. Maggie has remained a good
friend and I deeply admire her bravery to teach middle school science. Ximena (da Silva
Tavares Bongoll de Rossi) has the longest name of anyone I know. Kristina and I both
cut our teeth on GPCR projects and have commiserated on more than one topic on more
than one occasion.
Tim Miles knows how to chart his own path and excel at it. I’ve appreciated his
friendship and look forward to watching what he does in the future. We were ever so
fortunate to land Michael Post in the group. He’s carrying the nicotinic receptor torch
forward and smiles seem to erupt everywhere he goes. Oliver Shafaat and Fan Liu have
orders of magnitude more mathematical competence than I do. I really enjoyed my
GPCR collaborations with Fan and all of our conversations. The future involves photons
for Kayla Busby, Matt (Jefferson) Davis, and Paul (David?) Walton. These folks are
breaking new ground, which made my last year in the group a lot more intellectually
stimulating. They made it a whole lot more fun too. Betty Wong is bravely taking on
some fluorescence work, and is more than up to the task. She hasn’t been in the group
long, but everybody agrees she’s a force for good.
	  
vi	  
Finally, Matt Rienzo and Clint Regan were my companions in the south bay of
desks for the last few years and I’ll deeply miss them. Clint is steering the
photochemistry ship – making good progress and knowing the right questions to ask.
Matt can do very hard chemistry and very hard biology and is a very good person as well.
I had the privilege of working with three truly outstanding undergraduates in lab
during my graduate career: Jessica Swallow, Emily Blythe, and Jessica Hsu. All learned
the ropes in lab effortlessly and accomplished much, were great to work with, and were
often many steps ahead of me.
Friends in the Los Angeles area showed me that this is an awesome place to live
and is going to be an especially hard place to leave. Michael Van Vliet has been a
fantastic friend and a much needed beacon of normalcy beyond the Caltech community.
All of my cycling friends gave me a window into this city I would never have seen
otherwise and are all fantastic people. My roommates Alex Goldberg, James McKone,
and Judy Lattimer have been great friends and deserve a medal for putting up with my
eccentricities.
Finally, I want to thank my family, who I don't thank nearly enough. My parents
have always supported me unconditionally and serve as the strongest role models I could
ever ask for.

As my long and meandering journey at UCLA approaches completion, I reminisce
about my time at this fine university, and realize that I encountered so many special
people who have enriched my personal and academic life. For this, I am forever grateful.
I am indebted to my advisor and mentor, Professor William W-G. Yeh, who has
guided me throughout this project, strengthened my research skills and introduced me to
the fascinating world of water systems optimization. He taught me how to ask and to
answer questions adequately and was very patient for results to appear. Due to his
wisdom, generosity, creativity, elegance and unparalleled kindness, my overall technical
and life skills have been enhanced.
I would like to thank the other members of my doctoral committee, Sami W. Asmar,
Professors Steven A. Margulis, Diego Rosso and Michael K. Stenstrom for their presence,
pedagogy, valuable insight and support. I am grateful to Professor Margulis who
provided me with a teaching assistantship at the early stages of my graduate studies and
strengthened my understanding of hydrology and hydrometeorology. Special thanks to
Sami W. Asmar for our friendship and collaboration on several projects over the last
decade. His generosity and passion for science has allowed me to broaden my horizons,
enabling me to work with his group at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena. In
addition, because of his creativity and support of the arts, I was given the opportunity to
participate in his music group and to share poetry at different venues in Southern
California. I also extend my gratitude to Professor Diego Rosso. Our friendship and
academic collaboration has developed ever-since we started working on this research,
under Professor Yeh’s supervision. Professor Rosso’s creativity and diverse research
interests made complex topics approachable.
I would also like to extend my appreciation to all the other professors I had at UCLA–
Professors Terri S. Hogue, Jennifer A. Jay, Donald R. Kendall, Keith D. Stolzenbach and
Ne-Zheng Sun, for enriching my engineering knowledge and teaching me wonderful
lessons about water and the environment.
I wish to acknowledge all current and former staff at the Civil and Environmental
Engineering Department–especially, Maida Bassili, who kept reminding me that tenacity
and perseverance will ultimately pay off. I am also thankful for my co-workers and office
mates, both within and outside the university, for all that was learned and shared–
particularly with Scott Boyce and Wei-Chen Cheng at UCLA, and Julio C. Herrera at MI
Design, Inc.. My appreciation also goes to current and former Civil and Environmental
Engineering students and visiting scholars at UCLA–Yu-Wen Chen, Barton Forman,
Manuela Girotto, Ieda Hidalgo, Keith Musselman, Mahdi Navari, Adam J. Siade,
Zachary P. Stanko, Tim Ushijima, Che-Chuan Wu, Bin Xu and Renato Zambon.
This research could not have been possible without the relentless encouragement and
support from the following individuals and institutions: Professor Young C. Kim of
CSULA who introduced me to coastal engineering, expanded my understanding of fluid
mechanics and opened many doors for me to pursue academic research, Professor
Nazaret Dermendjian of CSUN who welcomed me more than three years ago as an
educator and friend, and supported me enthusiastically and unconditionally in my
pursuits. I am also grateful to Professor Donald G. Browne and the UCLA School of
Engineering and Applied Science for providing me with a teaching assistantship via the
engineering ethics program. I extend my gratitude to Robert L. Doneker of Mixzon, Inc.
who provided me with access to the CORMIX model and offered valuable insight into
the simulation and research processes. I wish to thank Professor Abbas Daneshvari, an art
historian, philosopher and friend, who constantly reminded me to work diligently and
pursue my endeavors. I also wish to thank Professor A.J. Racy of UCLA who generously
welcomed me several years ago as participant at his musical ensemble which has
enhanced my life, both musically and spiritually. His kind presence and wonderful
musical compositions have been comforting forces throughout my UCLA journey.
Special thanks to Antoine I. Harb for his friendship, support and encouragement, and for
introducing me to Professor Racy’s musical ensemble. I also thank Professor Adnan
Darwiche of UCLA for his positive encouragement and for gifting me with his scientific
and artistic knowledge.
My deep gratitude goes to my family. I thank my dear brother Omar and his family,
and my sister Lamia and her family. I also thank my nephew Ghassan (Jason) who has
always been a source of strength, intelligence and unconditional love. I give my deep
appreciation to my youngest sister Genane who has shown a remarkable enthusiasm
about this project and has always been a source of unwavering love and support. Last but
not least, I thank my father Ghassan and my mother Leila for their moral support,
boundless love and, above all, for teaching me many lessons in love and kindness.

All that I have accomplished as a PhD student was made possible with the help and
support of amazing people, both in my professional and personal life. I will always be beyond
grateful to my advisor, Peter Girguis, for the faith he had in me from the very beginning, his
continued patience and attention throughout my time in graduate school, and above all else, the
fact that that he always treated me as a peer. The scope of skills I learned in the Girguis lab is
beyond what I ever predicted I would as a graduate student: from wiring an outlet to identifying
a pipe-fitting to writing a proposal. I am thankful for all that I have learned from Pete, and I
know that I will only appreciate these things more as I move forward into other research. I also
thank my committee, Andrew Knoll, Colleen Cavanaugh and Christopher Marx ; their questions
were always balanced by encouragement and my dissertation is inestimably better because of
their input and help.
I must also express gratitude to the past and current members of the Girguis lab, as well
as others in the department of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology. I have been so fortunate to
be part of such a supportive and inspiring lab group; I now can’t imagine preparing a talk
without their invaluable insight and direction. I must especially thank Jon Sanders, who has
contributed, in both large and small ways, to every project I have worked on during my
dissertation; I am lucky to have found both a friend and colleague in Jon. And of course there are
my labmates, officemates, friends, and, at least in Kiana’s case, roommate, Kiana Frank and
Heather Olins; as well as my friend and lab neighbor, Dipti Nayak. They always challenged and
supported me, and made every day fun. I am grateful for their friendship, which I know will be
life-long.
Thank you to the many, many collaborators and coauthors that I have worked with as a
graduate student. The list is long, but special thanks to Charles Fisher, Erin Becker, George
!
Luther, Amy Gartman, Nicole Dubilier, Spencer Nyholm, and Frank Stewart. Additionally, this
work could have been done without the crew of the R/V Thomas G. Thompson and the ROV
JASON II. I am also grateful to the staff of the Ernst Mayr Library of the Museum of
Comparative Zoology at Harvard University for their acquisition of countless obscure articles
and books for me. And in terms of logistical and moral support, I am particularly indebted to
Jennifer Delaney and Stephanie Hillsgrove, who made lab logistical and administrative tasks
immeasurably easier.
I am so appreciative of the incredible friends and family that I have encouraging me
behind the scenes. Thank you to my extended family June and Steve Jones, Dana Jones, Erin
Cooper, Jordan Kunkes and Eve Boltax for their love and support. My old friends Kara
Gaughen, Jessica Russell, Alicia Widge, Laurel Aquadro and Christine Sun brighten my life in so
many ways and nobody makes me laugh as hard. My husband Andy Jones has been an
inspiration; I admire him for his unending optimism and constant curiosity. I am so grateful for
our partnership and could not have done this without him. Thank you to my sister Nina Kunkes,
whose wit and focus I admire, and whose love and support has been unwavering.
And finally, thank you to my parents, Daniel and Phyllis Beinart. My father always
encouraged my scientific interests, whether he was teaching me binary code at the kitchen table
or driving me to a before-school lab class in fourth grade. He gave me the skeptical, analytical
mind that makes science fun. My mother is my greatest cheerleader, and never fails to make me
feel like my work is important. She is why I strive to go as far as I can as a woman in this field,
and make the path easier for those coming after me. I will always be grateful, for they are the
reason I have made it this far.

The author would like to express his deep appreciation to Dr. Stephen O'Leary for
his unlimited support, guidance, and endless hours of fruitful and extremely rewarding
discussions throughout the years that led to the culmination of this work. His mentorship
and knowledge has helped me finesse both my research and academic skills and will
undoubtedly be a substantial contribution to my success in both my academic and
research careers. I also extend my sincerest gratitude to my committee members Drs. R.
Muscedere, A. Ahmadi, N. Zamani, and M. Mirhasani, for their valuable guidance and
important suggestions. Their feedback has provided me with the motivation to find the
right ideas to work on for my research. I would also like to thank Dr. R. Sobot for giving
me the honor to be on my committee and examine my work.
I would also like to thank Dr. Sid Ahmed, Head of the Electrical and Computer
Engineering Department, for his encouragement and guidance during my graduate studies
pursuit. Special thanks goes to Ms. Andria Ballo, the graduate secretary, for her genuine
assistance and care throughout my years of graduate studies at the University of Windsor.
I thank my brother Hussein for his care and support and our long phone conversations
that have given me the strength when I needed it the most. I thank my parents Ali and
Rafica for everything they have done for me, there are no words that can describe the
gratitude and love I feel towards you guys, nothing would have been possible without
you. Children take their parents for granted and this is one of those moments of truth
where I deeply realize everything you have done for me and all the things you have
taught me. It is because of all the sacrifices that you have made throughout those many
years that my accomplishments are made possible.
Last but not least I want to thank my wife Samar and daughters Leila and Angelina for
their unparalleled support, patience, encouragement, and for their faith in my talent and
ability to pursue my goals. I thank Samar for always being there for me in those moments
where every graduate student feels lost in the midst of their research, she always
managed to bring the sunshine to my grey skies. I thank Leila and Angelina for bringing
a smile to my face and giving me the breeze of fresh air each time I took things too
seriously.

you. Children take their parents for granted and this is one of those moments of truth
where I deeply realize everything you have done for me and all the things you have
taught me. It is because of all the sacrifices that you have made throughout those many
years that my accomplishments are made possible.
Last but not least I want to thank my wife Samar and daughters Leila and Angelina for
their unparalleled support, patience, encouragement, and for their faith in my talent and
ability to pursue my goals. I thank Samar for always being there for me in those moments
where every graduate student feels lost in the midst of their research, she always
managed to bring the sunshine to my grey skies. I thank Leila and Angelina for bringing
a smile to my face and giving me the breeze of fresh air each time I took things too
seriously.

The old saying, “There is no “I” in team” applies just as much in graduate school
as it does in sports. Although individual candidates do a large portion of their work
independently, it is through the help, assistance, and support of others that brings the
goal into sight. I’d like to take this opportunity to acknowledge and thank those
who’ve helped me throughout my studies at Cornell.
First, and above all, I’d like to express my deepest gratitude to my advisor,
Christopher K. Ober. I am so very fortunate to have had the opportunity be a part of
his group. His enthusiasm for my topic and tremendous expertise was very much
appreciated. Even more, I’m so thankful for all of the support and encouragement he
showed me over the years. I have never met a more patient, understanding person
who is willing to sacrifice his time to mentor and assist his students. Thank you for
your tutelage, advice, and guidance during my years at Cornell. Your friendship,
although at first unexpected, has been the driving force of my success and for that I am
forever grateful.
I would also like to thank my exceptional committee members, Professor Barbara
A. Baird and Professor Héctor D. Abruña for their significant research discussions and
suggestions. Their expertise and patience to explain topics outside of my field of
research has been invaluable. Without their collaboration and contributions, this thesis
would be incomplete.
I am grateful for having the opportunity to work with numerous research groups
and gain a greater understanding and appreciate for their field of work. Prof. George
Malliaras and has been very kind to invite me several times to his lab in Centre
Microélectronique de Provence, France for collaboration on a sensor project. His
discussions on transistors have been very beneficial. Additionally, Thomas Doublet
was very helpful teaching me about glucose sensing and PEDOT:PSS electrodes and it
was a pleasure to work with him.
Although our project is relatively new, I have enjoyed working with Dr. Katherine
Hajjar to explore the world of interfacing biological media and polymer brushes. Our
research discussions provided direction with great potential in the future. Thanks to
Dena Almeida and Arun Deora for their work testing our brush samples and for
providing enzyme/cell related guidance and suggestions.
For the biosensor work, my longest ongoing project, I would like to thank all of
the past and present people who made contributions. Thank you to Norah Smith,
Michele Tague, Youyong Xu, Hongjun Chen, Nicole L. Ritzert, Marcus Wilkes, and
Devin Wakefield. Collaboratively we have made so much progress and it has been
exciting working with each of you and seeing the development and advancement over
time.
Over the years group members have always been a source of help and support.
Special thanks to Dr. Youyong Xu who taught me lab technique and who was an
excellent role model and source of information during my first few years. I am so
grateful for the help and support from all the Ober group members past and present.
I appreciate your friendships and collaborations.
I gratefully acknowledge the funding support from the National Science
Foundation (NSF) in which much of this work was made possible. Also I would like
to thank the technical support from the staff in the Cornell Nanobiotechnology Center
(NBTC), the Cornell Nanofabrication Facility (CNF), Cornell Center for Materials
Research (CCMR), and Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source (CHESS). Special
thanks to Rob Ilic who was instrumental in teaching me everything about lithography
and device fabrication and John Grazul for his help with the TEM.
Finally, I am so grateful to all of my friends and family. I have made friendships
here at Cornell that I will cherish for a life time. Our fun times together got me
through some very frustrating periods in the lab and I will treasure those memories the
rest of my life. My family’s love and faith in me also provided the support I needed to
succeed. I am so thankful for everything my parents provided for me and everything
they did to get me to where I am today. Thank you for your love, assurance and
encouragement.
A heartfelt thanks to everyone, I have now joined the Ph.D.
community.

This journey would not have been possible without the support of many people over the
past years.
I would like to thank the members of the Biorobotics Lab, those who helped develop the
robot and so many of the tools th at made it usable, those who weren’t afraid to tell me when
my crazy ideas were not going to work, and those who kept the robot working so I always
had a reliable platform. And of course, thanks go to Peggy Martin, without who the lab
would certainly cease to function!
I also owe thanks to the collaborators I have worked with and discussed ideas with
outside of the lab, especially those at the Museum of Science and Industry for being so
supportive during three days of data collection. I also appreciate the support of members of
CMU’s Auton lab for graciously adopting me during conference preparation and for supplying
computation resources.
I am grateful for the support of my committee, especially for the advice and time given
by my co-advisors, Howie Choset and Jeff Schneider.
Finally, I thank my family for their love and support. My parents have encouraged and
helped me through so many years of school and life - from the hours spent with me on my
elementary school class papers and science fair projects to those teaching bigger life lessons.
I now realize how they laid a solid foundation for all th at I do. This thanks is also especially
deserved by my wife for her generosity in proofreading everything I wrote and her endless
patience as she endured late nights in the lab, pre-deadline stresses, and uncertain future
plans.

The work presented herein could not have been done without the support of many people. First and foremost,
I would like to recognize my advisor, Professor Sergio Pellegrino, whose vision, guidance, and behind-thescenes orchestration enabled me to reach this point. He never takes “it can’t be done” as a ﬁnality, and always
pushes forward and higher. I would also like to recognize my thesis committee: Professor Guruswami “Ravi”
Ravichandran, Professor Julia Greer, and Professor Dennis Kochmann. I make a special acknowledgement
to Ravi, whose gentle encouragements from time to time were always welcome. I’d also like to thank the
Keck Institute for Space Studies and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory for funding our eﬀorts and believing in
our vision.
Throughout my time here at Caltech I have had several mentors to whom I am eternally grateful for
their advice and wisdom: Dr. James Breckinridge, for transforming an optically illiterate engineering student
into a Ph.D. recipient who works on telescope design and active optics. His tireless dedication and the vast
experience he voluntarily brings to our eﬀorts are quite commendable and admirable. Dr. Risaku Toda,
for introducing me to the world of microfabrication, and patiently teaching me the various methods and
machinery that allowed me to make these active mirrors. Mr. Victor White, who always had a “crazy idea”
whenever I would get stuck, which turned out to be not so crazy more often than not. Dr. Harish Manohara
and Dr. Andrew Shapiro, for establishing the collaboration between our lab and his, and working with my
advisor to enable new areas of research.
I have collaborated with many people during my time at Caltech on research, projects, and classes, and
special acknowledgements go to Professor Chiara Daraio, Professor Abha Misra, Dr. Greg Davis, Dr. Yunjin
Kim, Dr. Terry Gdoutos, Dr. Namiko Yamamoto, Dr. Marie Laslandes, and fellow mirror researcher John
Steeves. The staﬀ here in GALCIT were also extremely helpful, especially Petros Arakelian, Joe Haggerty,
Kathleen Jackson, Christine Ramirez, and, of course, Dimity Nelson, who keeps the place running.
I would like to also generally acknowledge past and present members of my lab group and project team,
whose hard work were always an inspiration for me and pushed me to always keep going: the staﬀ and
researchers in the Microdevices Lab who were always so friendly and helpful, my fellow classmates who
helped each other through the ﬁrst year, and the various Ae105 classes who put so much hard work into the
design project in such a limited timeframe. I would like to thank my friends for their support, and last but
most importantly, my family. All so scattered about, and yet always so close.
