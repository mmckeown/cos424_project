I am extremely grateful to my graduate advisor, Dr. David Pellman, for offering
me the opportunity to study with him. David has been a very generous scientific mentor.
He always had time to discuss experiments and help prioritize which directions were
most exciting and would contribute to a fuller understanding of my scientific questions.
His approach to performing the most convincing experiments possible to test hypotheses
sets a high bar that draws out the best from his trainees. At the same time, while having
an excellent nose for when an exciting result was in the making, he gave me tremendous
freedom to learn how to do experiments, as well as patience during my learning process.
David has also been unfailingly generous in his financial support for experiments and for
giving me the opportunity to present my work at conferences. Getting to observe his
process of doing science first-hand, along with being exposed to his innovative and broad
scientific thinking has been both stimulating and rewarding. David’s ability to guide so
many diverse projects in the lab is truly impressive. I am thankful and proud to be a
student of David’s.
David’s passion for science and for training the next generation of scientists is
obvious, as demonstrated by his ability to consistently fill the lab with an outstanding
group of students, post-docs, technicians, and others, as well as in his support for his
trainees. Throughout my years in the Pellman laboratory I’ve been very fortunate to learn
from many people. First among these I thank Dr. Satoshi Yoshida for his mentorship,
excitement, for showing me the awesome power of yeast genetics and cell biology, as
well as for collaborating with me on this work. I also thank Dr. Keiko Kono for being my

first introduction both to the lab and to budding yeast during my rotation, and for her
advice and insight after I joined.
Many other labmates over the years gave me friendship, enjoyable discussions,
and collegial advice, both on scientific matters and on life in general. In particular, I’m
grateful to my lunch-buddy Dr. Susana Godinho. Her excitement for science, friendship,
and support were invaluable and greatly contributed to the pleasant atmosphere of the
Pellman lab. Her recent lunch-successor Dr. Yosef Kaplan has also performed admirably
in this position. I thank my fellow PhD student Hugo Arellano-Santoyo and Dr.
Alexander Spektor for many adventures in and out of the lab. I am also grateful for
having had the chance to work with Drs. Xiaolei Su, Shawnna Buttery, Karen Crasta,
Neil Ganem, and many others.
I am also thankful to the leadership and administration of the Biological and
Biomedical Sciences program at Harvard Medical School for giving me the chance to
study in such a stimulating environment. Further, I’m grateful to my dissertation advisory
committee, including Drs Fred Winston, Ulrike Eggert, and David Levin for their advice
and guidance over the course of this work.
Of course, this work would also not have been possible without the constant love
and support of my family, starting with my parents David and Ann Atkins. Their hard
work provided me with the opportunities necessary to pursue my goals in life, and along
with my sister Kaitlin they have provided me the true ideal of a loving family. My
gratitude and love extend to my grandparents, Frank and Mary Jane Velesz and Dewey
and Ellen Atkins, and our family on both sides. Finally, I’d like to thank my friends,
notably Sam Nigh, Adam Couture, and Basia Niebudek, for their bonhomie and support.

Above all I give thanks and praise to God for with Him all things are
possible. “I can do everything through him who gives me strength” (Philippians
4:13).
I am deeply grateful to my dissertation Chair, Dr. Linda Hauser. Thank
you for your time, your patience and your willingness to continue asking the
difficult questions. Your commitment to remain steadfast and positive throughout
this journey has made it possible. You are truly a blessing to me. Special thanks
to my committee members Dr. Sharon Brown-Welty who persevered to bring the

difficult time, thank you.
The love and encouragement from my family has made this possible.
Thank you to my Mom and Dad, Anne and Stanley, for instilling in each of your
children the knowledge that we are all truly loved, cherished, and supported in all
we do. To my four sons; Benjamin, Jacob, Eli, and Nickolas, I thank God every
day that I was honored with the privilege of being your “Mom.” Each of you
makes me proud in all you do, and you have grown into such amazing young men.
This was for you, to model for you that any goal that you set your mind to can be
attained with hard work and dedication. Persevere in all you do and stay true to
who you are. God has a plan for you. “For I know the plans I have for you,”
declares the Lord, “plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you
hope and a future” (Jeremiah 29:11).
Thank you to Jennifer my incredible daughter-in-law, Ben’s wife, and
Nicole, Jacob’s girlfriend, for being there for them when I was not. We are truly
blessed that you have chosen to be a part of our family. Thank you to my
wonderful grandsons, Gavin and Logan, I can’t wait to do all of the fun things
with you that I missed while writing this dissertation: trips to the park, going to
the movies, visiting theme parks, and anything else you can dream of.
Thank you also to some very special young people who have supported and
encouraged me every step along the way: Chelsey, Gerardo, Garrett, Jodi and
Erika, you are my inspiration. Your belief in me kept me going, even when the
going got tough! Dream Big!
Special thanks to my Cohort family, especially, Dean, Blanca and Jeff; you
continuously encouraged me and believed that I had something to offer.
Lastly, my greatest debt of gratitude to my incredible husband Ross, most
often referred to as the “best husband on Earth.” For more than 31 years you have
been by my side for all life’s experiences. You have had the wisdom to know
when to take my side and when to give another perspective, thank you for your
honesty. You never stop believing in me, your support has given me the courage to
take chances, and you have always been there for the outcome, positive and
negative, supporting the effort. You never question, you never doubt, you never
complain, and you have had to sacrifice so much. I am grateful for the
opportunity to share my life with you. Thank you.

A dissertation is a journey, and not one taken alone. I would like to acknowledge
those who have taken this journey with me, for which I am eternally grateful.
I believe that with God all things are possible. These values have been instilled in
me by my family, whom I would like to thank first and foremost. To my mom, Melanie
Farmer, thank you for all of your support, not just while I have been working on my
doctorate but for all of my schooling. You have worked hard in so many ways to make
sure I get an education. From working two jobs to cooking me meals, doing laundry, or
running my errands, you do all the little things that would ease the stress of going to
school. As far as I am concerned, you have worked just as hard as I have to obtain my
degree. This is for both of us; now we can both rest! Thank you for your love. I love
you right back. To my granny Annie Burney, thank you for praying for me every step of
the way during my education (I needed them all). You always make sure to check on me
and encourage me to keep up with my lessons, and you never forget to tell me that you
love me. Now you can call me Dr. PCR#1! To my aunts Rhonda Farmer and Michelle
(Mitchel) Farmer, you are the two best aunts I could ask for. You always keep me in line
and make sure I have some fun along the way. I appreciate your love and support, even
when I am stressed and pressed for time. Now I can join in on more events with you two.
To my uncle Rod “brother” Farmer, you send me love and support from miles away.
Even though we live far apart, you have been right there with the rest of the family
cheering me on and always making me feel special. Thank you. To Little Miss Arianna
Farmer, thank you for making RobRob laugh and being a ray of sunshine when I am tired
from school work. I will always make sure that you hold education in a high regard as
well. Now you can call me Dr. RobRob. And to Annabel Farmer, thanks for being so
cute and playful.
To my extended family, the Farmers and the Walkers, thank you for all of the
encouragement through phone calls, e-mails, texts, and sometimes even through social
media. To my great uncles Charlie and CJ Walker, their wives Alma and Claudette, and
my favorite great Auntie Ida “Byrd” Oliney, thank you so much for your direct continued
support through this process. It really means so very much to me.
To my cousins from California and Arizona all the way to Texas, I would like to
especially thank Ronnie, Dana, Brian, Sean, Jennifer, Chris Sr., Billie, the Stephanies,
Uncle Mike, and Arleta—I appreciate all the words of encouragement you have all given
me through this process. You all have shown me that the love of family is really the
greatest love of all.
My journey would not be complete without the help of some wonderful friends!
I met many lifelong friends in this program. Thank you to my Comfort Inn crew, the
fantastic 6 Drs., Nick, Obed, Paul, (Auntie) Linda, Esmirna, and Jasmine. With all of the
fun, food/wine, and laughter we had during practicum weekends, it’s a wonder we all
made it to the finish line! But I would not have it any other way. Your encouragement
and honesty are really what helped me to make it this far and to be able to join you all on
the other side as Dr.
LG 145 was the best learning group ever! Thank you Stacy, Jasmine, Richy,
Richard, Tammie, Martha, Michael, Carolyn, and Stephany. I loved our traditions
(orange converse and canary), and our learning group meetings were the glue that held
me together all 3 years.
Dr. Martha, you were the best roommate, and I will always remember our fun late
night chats until 1:00 a.m., and being distracted by TV shows like “Amen” and “Storage
Wars” instead of doing our homework. Thank you for all the laughs, support, friendship,
and for not showing me composite sketches.
Dr. Deloris, your sweet and gentle spirit was so refreshing in this crazy and hectic
program that we went through together. Thank you for always being a calm source I
could count on, and thank you for your prayers!
On the home front, I had friends who kept me in check and continually
encouraged me along the way as well.
To Katie Althoff, thank you for always indulging in odd fun activities/
conversations with me. As you know, it has kept me sane the whole time during this
process. And I don’t care what the doctors say, you have the best heart of anyone I have
ever known. L&L (minus one) sisterhood forever!
To my best friend, Charyl Beard, thank you for being crazy you and helping me to
break out of drone status during school by making me laugh about our silly friendship. I
am so happy to have you in my life.
To CJ Cameron, you and Kaylee are like family, and just like family you have
been a source of love and support throughout my journey. Thank you.
To my BFFSM, Molly Campos, you have supported me in many ways through
this process and have been by my side the whole time. I appreciate our “three star”
friendship and am so happy we have decided that we will definitely be friends forever, no
matter what!
To Cyndi “Rye” Delgra, thanks for the many trips to get yogurt and phone calls of
encouragement. You are a true friend, and I am happy to have you in my life.
To my second family, the Francises, thank you Ken, Cherri, Alexis, Alicia, and
Aaron for always giving me a second home to vent at. Thank you for all of the home
cooked meals, wine, long talks, and encouraging words you have given me these past 4
years and even before. Thank you, Cherri, for proving that a boss can really become a
best friend. I love you all.
To Whitney and Chris Ganczewski, I am pretty sure no two people are more fun
than you two! Now I can say, “I survived” this doctoral experience, and the fun we have
all had together definitely helped me. You two have always been very supportive of my
education and me. Thank you.
To Dr. LB, what can I say? I am here because of you! All the processing, music,
dancing, crying, perfume, French fries/drinks, shopping, laughing, more processing, and
understanding each other 100% have made this journey unforgettable. I am so happy we
did this together. Gracias.
Thank you to my coworkers at Spectrum who have really helped add to my
research. The experiences I have had have helped me understand our industry more.
Thank you, Tamara Sweeny, for all you have taught me about the “right way” to work in
our industry. We have mastered teamwork in document control and learned that a little
fun helps too! I am happy to call you friend.
Marilyn Gisstennar and Ann Avery, thank you for always keeping it real and for
the encouragement and help during the last part of my dissertation. You both are great
friends. To Lisa Bauman, thank you for showing and teaching me about true leadership.
To my CLU and FAABT crew, Traci, Shannon, Leah, Felicia, and Laura. You
women have kept up with me and never stopped inviting me to life events since the day
we met. I appreciate you being so accommodating to my school schedule these past few
years and encouraging me along the way. I love all of you ladies and look forward to
being able to make the next event without school interruptions.
Lastly, thanks to my committee members and University of La Verne faculty,
without whom this dissertation would still just be a thought in my mind.
To my special editor—your careful eye and attention to detail have been so
helpful. Thank you for all the special things you have done to make my dissertation a
masterpiece! Thank you also for all of the support.
Dr. Keith Larick, thank you for your faith in me during this process. I still
remember our first conversation about my topic over a 7 a.m. breakfast during a summer
practicum weekend. You made me feel that it would be possible to write a dissertation
on this topic, and you were right! Thanks for all of the enlightening educational
information you have given to me these past 3 years, and thank you always for your
support. I sincerely appreciate everything you have done to help me get through this
process.
Stacy, you have had to pull double duty with me in learning group and with my
dissertation, no easy task I know! But your honesty and hard work have made my
dissertation something I can be very proud of. Thank you, thank you, thank you!
Lori, thank you for being the “expert” on my dissertation. From the day I met
you, you have never failed to encourage me and always reminded me to believe in
myself. I appreciate that. I am honored to have you on my committee, especially this
year. I will never forget your kindness.
To my entire ULV class, I really do believe we were the best class. We certainly
laughed, danced, and joked our way through this program and, best of all, learned so
much together. I enjoyed every practicum and never got bored!
To Drs. Magee, DeVore, Hyatt, and Roberts, thanks for all the education on
teamwork and organizations. I hope to make you all proud by being the leader you have
taught me to be.
I always have said that education is so special because it is the one thing that no
one can ever take from you. Thank you all for helping me to add to my education.

I am grateful to many people and organizations who have taught and
supported me along the way. First, I am greatly indebted to White Earth
community members who have extended their generosity and hospitality to me
since I began my studies in economic anthropology at the University of
Minnesota. I am also grateful to Winona LaDuke and the White Earth Land
Recovery Project staff, especially Robert Shimek and Florence Goodman.
My studies were supported by the Center for Urban and Regional Affairs,
White Earth Land Recovery Project, Vocational and Rehabilitation Services, the
Department of Anthropology, and the Center for Advanced Feminist Studies.
I am especially grateful to my committee members Guy Gibbon, Frank
Miller, and Jean O'Brien. I also want to thank Timothy Dunnigan, Kathleen

My deepest appreciation goes to my advisor Stephen Gudeman who has
always supported and encouraged my efforts.
Finally, I want to thank my family for their support and encouragement.
