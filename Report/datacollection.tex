Write about how we collected the data -- how we scraped it, what methods we used to decide exactly which PhDs to get, and so on.

Then talk about how we got the acknowledgements sections out of the PDFs. What the issues were? How often extraction failed, roughly. Bag of words and positive ratio extraction from the text.
