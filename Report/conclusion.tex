Our project was a success as far as data collection and feature extraction. These areas were much mroe complex than we had anticipated them being, but in the end we were quite successful in building a text corpus with associated metadata.

Our analyses returned interesting results, but ultimately further investigation would need to be done in order to give strong conclusions. A thorough validation of the link between positivity in acknowledgement and student exit-satisfaction is also required -- an obvious way to go about this would be to individually contact students who have recently submitted and survey them on satisfaction, but such a procedure is outside the scope of this project. On the text-analysis side, an interesting question would be to see what other information can be gleaned from an analysis of the acknowledgement (or other sections of the PhD); we had hoped to perform such an analysis but were stymied by lack of time.

In conclusion, it seems there is reasonable evidence that acknowledgement sections can give insights into student satisfactions, and quite probably information well beyond this. This area could benefit from further research.
